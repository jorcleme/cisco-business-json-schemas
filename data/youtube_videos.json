I'll choose the US VLAN tagging as yes and enter the VLAN ID as 2. for this example I will not touch the traffic or scheduling settings click on the apply button you can see that my guest underscore Wi-Fi WLAN has been created for the last step in this first video you need to create the WLAN users under wireless settings select WLAN users click on the add WLAN user button enter a username I'll enter guest one the password and the confirmed password make sure your guest user option is enabled optionally you can provide the description click apply and repeat the process to create another user I'll name this one guest 2. enable the guest user toggle enter the password confirm the password and description and click apply repeat as needed when complete click on the red save icon on top of the screen to save the settings on your cbw access point click ok [Music] great you're well on your way the next video will get you to the Finish Line click the link in the description to see the next steps thanks for watching I'll see you soon [Music]",

I can click on the edit button for lag 1 to see the members details of that leg Dynamic legs on the CBS 350 support up to a maximum of eight active members the active members in this example are one through eight specifically gigabit Ethernet one slash one one to one slash eight standby members are the gigabit Ethernet one slash nine and one slash 10 ports navigating to port management and then the port settings option you can see the operational status of port numbers 1 to 10 are showing as up they are all part of that Dynamic lag to demonstrate how changes affect a dynamic leg I just removed port number seven now port number nine will be added to the active members list and Port 7 will show a status of down I'll refresh the page to see those details that's all there is to it now you know the difference between a static and a dynamic lag how they function and how they can work for you thanks for watching I'll see you next time foreign [Music]",

check or adjust this on a Cisco business switch next foreign to see the CPU utilization in Cisco business switches log into the switch with the putty application and type the command show CPU utilization currently the CPU utilization on my switch has been at two percent for the past five seconds and the last minute for the last five minutes it is showing at four percent this is without SNMP polling now I'll apply some SNMP polling on my Cisco business 350 switch and check the CPU utilization before I do that I need to make sure that the SNMP service is enabled to check this log into the web user interface of the switch navigate to the SNMP menu and select the communities option here you can see that SNMP is enabled on the switch the community string is also configured for the SNMP Management station make sure yours is configured verify the ipconfigured on the switch this is required for SNMP polling for this example the IP is configured as 172.19.1.1 for the VLAN 1

drop down menu you can now see the switch system name uptime capabilities and other parameters that are part of the system subtree this is just a small set of queries I can see the current CPU utilization on the switch using the show CPU utilization command currently the CPU utilization is showing seven percent for the past five seconds and three percent for the past one and five minutes I can run that command a couple more times to see the CPU utilization it's almost the same or even less than before this shows that SNMP polling isn't a factor with a small set of queries next I'll execute an extended SNMP query to the switch and check the CPU utilization before I start that process I'll clear the earlier results I'll select the complete MIB tree showing on the left panel this will request many more parameters from the switch as shown under each section of the subtree I'll select get subtree from the operations drop down menu this will be a long process because a lot of

command you can see how the current CPU utilization on the switch has jumped to 76 percent for the last five seconds oh boy that quick increase was due to the excessive SNMP polling that might cause issues on the network again I'll run that command now it's at 78 that value will eventually influence the percentage for the one minute and five minute Mark as well I will run that command a couple more times to see the CPU utilization on the switch it is reducing slowly since most of the queries have already been executed I'll stop the SNMP polling and clear the table just for a clean slate the CPU utilization on the switch has been reduced to nine percent now and for the last minute the value has increased to 55 percent that was when the queries were running on the switch to see the CPA utilization percentage decrease I'll run the command a few more times the last one minute is showing as 10 and 5 minutes at 15 percent you've now seen for yourself how excessive SNMP polling causes

switch it could be from this process happening too often in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how excessive SNMP polling can cause high Central Processing Unit CPU utilization and how to check or adjust this on a Cisco business switch next foreign to see the CPU utilization in Cisco business switches log into the switch with the putty application and type the command show CPU utilization currently the CPU utilization on my switch has been at two percent for the past five seconds and the last minute for the last five minutes it is showing at four percent this is without SNMP polling now I'll apply some SNMP polling on my Cisco business 350 switch and check the CPU utilization before I do that I need to make sure that the SNMP service is enabled to check this log into the web user interface of the switch navigate to the SNMP menu and select the communities option here you can see that SNMP is enabled on the switch the community string is also configured for the SNMP Management station make sure yours is configured verify the ipconfigured on the switch this is required for SNMP polling for this example the IP is configured as 172.19.1.1 for the VLAN 1 interface I'm using one MIB browser for SNMP polling on this browser enter the IP address of the switch in the address field click on the advanced option to specify the SNMP port number the read and write community and the SNMP version the right Community is not required to read information from the switch after that under the MIB tree select the desired object ID or subtree from which you want to get information and or parameters this is located on the left panel I have selected sys dscr short verb system description for this example now I'll select the get bulk options from the operations drop down menu you can now see the switch system name uptime capabilities and other parameters that are part of the system subtree this is just a small set of queries I can see the current CPU utilization on the switch using the show CPU utilization command currently the CPU utilization is showing seven percent for the past five seconds and three percent for the past one and five minutes I can run that command a couple more times to see the CPU utilization it's almost the same or even less than before this shows that SNMP polling isn't a factor with a small set of queries next I'll execute an extended SNMP query to the switch and check the CPU utilization before I start that process I'll clear the earlier results I'll select the complete MIB tree showing on the left panel this will request many more parameters from the switch as shown under each section of the subtree I'll select get subtree from the operations drop down menu this will be a long process because a lot of information will get fetched from the scroll bar showing on the right side of the screen you may notice that I'll check the CPU utilization on this switch again using the same show CPU utilization command you can see how the current CPU utilization on the switch has jumped to 76 percent for the last five seconds oh boy that quick increase was due to the excessive SNMP polling that might cause issues on the network again I'll run that command now it's at 78 that value will eventually influence the percentage for the one minute and five minute Mark as well I will run that command a couple more times to see the CPU utilization on the switch it is reducing slowly since most of the queries have already been executed I'll stop the SNMP polling and clear the table just for a clean slate the CPU utilization on the switch has been reduced to nine percent now and for the last minute the value has increased to 55 percent that was when the queries were running on the switch to see the CPA utilization percentage decrease I'll run the command a few more times the last one minute is showing as 10 and 5 minutes at 15 percent you've now seen for yourself how excessive SNMP polling causes high CPU utilization on Cisco business switches leading to packet drops and other issues so be careful when you're configuring SNMP polling on your network and adjust it as needed thanks for watching I'll see you next time foreign foreign [Music]",

this edition of Cisco tech talk I'll explain some Catalyst 1200 and 1300 features and configurations next [Music] I'll begin by covering the global LEDs on the switch when the switch is powered on and Performing self-tests or acquiring an IP address the system LED lights flash steadily green if the LED flashes Amber the switch has detected one of the following a configuration file error a hardware failure or a firmware failure the switch comes with the factory default IP address of 192.168.1.254 and a subnet mask of Slash 24. when the switch is using this factory default IP address the system LED continuously flashes you will see a steady green when the switch is using a dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP server assigned IP address this is typical since DHCP is enabled by default if you have configured a static IP address you will also see a steady green LED the c1200 and c1300 switches provide a simple intuitive dashboard that automates switch deployment monitoring and life cycle management a resource utilization graph the system Health display and a brief overview of the ram logs are easily accessible next I'll walk you through the process of installing and managing your device to get started you need to log into the web user interface connect your computer to one of the switchboards with an ethernet cable make sure everything is powered on your computer needs to be on the same IP subnet of the switch any address from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.253 if it is not you will need to temporarily change the IP address on your computer from that IP pool open a web browser and enter the IP address of the switch 192.168.1.254 this is the default address when you first log into the switch the username and password are both Cisco and all lowercase letters after this initial login you will have to change both the username and password once that is set head to the configuration wizard section of the navigation pane from here you can configure the switch by using the various links and following the on-screen instructions let's run the getting started wizard you can use the default hostname or create a new one this screen can be used to generate a new IP address the systems interface choosing none will keep the current settings the system clock can be set using a simple Network time protocol sntp server alternatively the date and time can be imported from a local computer now you can move on to the VLAN Setup Wizard here you can select the interface that will serve as your trunk interface Port 9 will be used in this example since it is connected to my router you can also use this panel to create a new VLAN I'll designate VLAN 10 as admin Port 9 will serve as the trunk port for untagged VLAN 10 traffic VLAN 10 can also have access interfaces added to it on this switch I will choose ports 5 and 6. to examine the file management for the switch navigate to administration file management and then firmware operations a file management system application will organize and save the access files on your device these system files include configuration data and the firmware image here you can manage the firmware file that is used with the reboot modify configuration files internally and copy files to and from an external device [Music] for this next feature select Administration and then the system log section select log settings by default system logs are enabled system logging allows a device to produce multiple independent logs each log is a collection of messages that describe system events the pin utility is another useful feature of the switch a ping test sees if a remote host can be reached and notes the round trip time for each packet sent ping works by sending internet control message protocol or icmp Echo request packets to the Target host once sent it waits for an icmp Echo reply when it is received it calculates the round trip time and Records any packet loss power over Ethernet or Poe can be very beneficial on the switch if you can power devices with the switch it can eliminate expensive wiring reduce the number of cables and easily expand the network the c1200 and c1300 series switches support IEEE 802.3az standards IEEE 802.3bt Poe and IEEE 802.318 Poe plus up to 30 watts per Port the poe power allocation is dynamic and power mapping scales up to a maximum of 740 watts of Poe plus power intelligent power management allows for flexible power allocation across all ports with Perpetual Poe the poe plus power is maintained during a switch reload the last feature I want to highlight is web-based Authentication this feature provides a consistent interface to authenticate all types of host devices and operating systems eliminating the complexity of deploying IEEE 802.1x clients on each endpoint there you have it this has been a quick overview of the Catalyst 1200 and 1300 switches thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "stacking is the combining of two or more switches into one logical unit the unit is represented in the network with one IP and Mac address stacking can have many advantages including simplifying the network topology spanning tree protocol calculations and increasing the convergence of the network in addition stacking conserves IP addresses since the stack needs only one if the switches weren't stacked they would each need an IP address CBS 350-4x switches support stacking but there are some requirements stackable switches must have at least two ports supporting a speed of 10 gigabytes per second and switches in a stack must have the same firmware version there are native and hybrid stack modes native stack delivers a more optimal configuration of the stack and higher capacity but for Native stacking switches must have compatible internal Hardware on this Cisco webpage you can see General guidelines for CBS switch stacking it provides useful information like a list of stackable CBS models an explanation of native and hybrid modes and a stack selector that shows the mode needed for different combinations of switches the link to this article is in the description in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to configure native stacking on your Cisco business 350-4x series switches in my example I will stack a CBS 350-24 ngp-4x and a CBS 350-24fp-4x switch they can be stacked in Native mode so I'm going to proceed with configuring the switches starting with the first switch navigate to Administration stack management check the native stacking checkbox select the stacking ports at least two stacking ports must be selected next choose the unit ID after reset this is the ID it will have after the stack is established this value can be set to Auto if Auto is selected switches will automatically negotiate their IDs otherwise you can manually select a unit ID when you select manual you must pay attention not to give the same ID to different switches or they will not form the stack I'll select one for this switch click apply and reboot after that log into the second switch go to Administration and then stack management the stack mode is native stacking select two ports supporting 10 gigabytes per second and then unit ID after reset for this switch I'll select two click apply and reboot during the reboot of the switches you can connect stacking ports between them after the stack is established you can see both units of the stack under Administration and then stack management once the stack is established It Is reachable by just one IP address which is usually the IP address of the active unit in this example you can see that the CBS 350-24 ngp-4x switch is the active unit unit 2 is the standby unit the difference between active and standby is that the active switch is the controller of the stack the standby would become active if the active unit is unreachable next you can add an additional switch to the stack to do this add new stacking ports to unit 2 that will connect to the new Switch then apply and reboot the stack be sure to save the running configuration and backup so the configuration will remain after a reboot on the new Switch you need to configure it so that it can join navigate to Administration and then stack management select native stacking and select stacking ports leave the unit ID after reset to auto you're allowed to combine Auto with manual selections then apply and reboot now after the stack reboot you can see the third unit joined to the stack Auto selection has applied ID3 to the new Switch great one important characteristic of stacking is stack topology up to now we've been using chain topology but if we connect one of the stacking ports of unit 3 to unit 1 the stack topology will change to ring I will physically take one stacking port on unit 3 and connect it to unit 1. as you can see now the stack topology has changed to a ring topology and the diagram has changed now unit 3 is connected to both unit 1 and unit 2. if you want to add more switches to the stack use the same process but I don't need to walk you through it you've got it from here thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

RX the last option is for outgoing traffic from Port 1. TX in this example I'll select both RX and TX now with these settings all traffic passing through Port 1 is copied and carried over rspan VLAN 13 through reflector port 2. moving along you'll need some configurations on the remote switch in my example this is sw2 on this switch I'll also create an rspan VLAN with the same ID of 13. navigate to VLAN management and then VLAN settings to create the VLAN 13. [Music] go to status and statistics rspan VLAN and again select VLAN 13 from the drop down menu under session destinations click the plus icon to create a new session I'll select local interface as the Destination type since I have connected the traffic analyzer to the local Port of sw2 select the physical Port where the traffic analyzer is connected for me that's port 15. select the network traffic enable checkbox so that you can use this port as a network Port as well click apply to save the settings go to session sources to add a new session again make sure to use the same session and destination session you created earlier The Source interface must be the remote VLAN VLAN 13 for me click apply and you should be set great now rspan is configured to carry traffic on both switches to confirm this use a packet capture tool like Wireshark to verify that mirrored traffic is reaching it to distinguish the mirrored traffic coming over the rspan from the actual Network traffic passing through the port you filter packets to show only those generated by the device connected to SW port 1. you can see the actual traffic that is copied and carried by rspan there you have it our span has been configured and verified on both your local and remote Cisco business switches thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "in the second of this two-part series of Cisco tech talk I'll go over general questions that relate to security and remote access for Cisco business dashboard or CBD [Music] The Cisco business dashboard have backdoor access to my devices no when Cisco business dashboard discovers a supported Cisco device it will attempt to access the device using the factory default credentials for that device with the default username and password Cisco or the default SNMP community public if the device configuration has been changed from the default then it will be necessary for the user to supply correct credentials to Cisco business dashboard how secure are the credentials stored in Cisco business dashboard credentials for accessing Cisco business dashboard are irreversibly hashed using the shaw 512 algorithm credentials for devices and other services such as the Cisco active advisor are reversibly encrypted using the AES 128 algorithm how do I recover a lost password for the web user interface UI if you've lost the password for all the admin accounts in the web UI you can reset the password by logging onto the console of the probe and running the CBD probe recover password tool or logging on the console of the probe and running the Cisco business dashboard recover password tool this tool resets the password for the Cisco account to the default of Cisco or if the Cisco account has been removed it will recreate the account with the default password when I connect to the web UI of a device from Cisco business dashboard Network management is the session secure Cisco business dashboard tunnels the remote access session between the device and the user the protocol used between the probe and the device will depend on the end device configuration but Cisco business dashboard will always establish the session using a secure protocol if one is enabled for example https will be preferred over HTTP if the user is connecting to the device via the dashboard the session will pass through an encrypted tunnel as it passes between the dashboard and the probe regardless of the protocols enabled on the device the connection between the user's web browser and the dashboard will always be https why does my remote access session with the device immediately log out when I open a remote access session to another device when you access a device via Cisco business dashboard the browser sees each connection as being with the same web server the dashboard and so we'll present cookies from each device to every other device if multiple devices use the same cookie name then there is the potential for one device's cookie to be overwritten by another device this is most often seen with session cookies and the result is that the cookie is only valid for the most recently visited device all other devices that use the same cookie name will see the cookie as being invalid and we'll log out of the session that's a wrap for our two-part FAQ series thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

        "transcript": "a fresh start sometimes it's important to wipe the Slate clean in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain some ways to do a factory reset on The Cisco Business Wireless cbw 150 series access points and mesh extenders [Music] there are multiple reasons to do a factory reset in some cases you may want to reset your entire network to reconfigure the primary AP role the easiest way to do this is to go to the web user interface to get to the reset button navigate to the advanced menu primary AP tools and then configuration management scroll down and click the reset to factory default button a message saying this action can't be undone are you sure you want to erase the existing primary AP configuration and reboot will pop up click yes and it'll reset all of the network configuration data most often you will want to do a factory reset to start your entire network out from scratch but there might be times when you might want to do something different for example maybe you want a particular access point that has a configuration issue or other problem to be reset maybe the issue is on a mesh extender to factory reset just one device you can go to the monitoring menu and then access points find the access point or mesh extender you want to reset and select it then go to the tools menu and hit the factory default button to reset that particular one after that it will reboot that access point or mesh extender it will then join the network and re-download the configuration data the last option for a factory reset is to do it physically on the device if you need to reset either your entire network or just an individual access point or mesh extender grab the device if it's an access point from a power off status meaning the device had been shut down with the ethernet cable unplugged press the reset button that is next to the gigabit Ethernet port hold it in while powering the system on by either plugging in the poe injector or plugging in the ethernet cable to supply power to the device press and hold it for about 20 seconds you'll know you can let go after you've seen the lights on the device cycle through you will want to wait until the pattern goes from green to green red and then finally to a flashing green State then let go this will factory reset the individual access point now if you need to factory reset the mesh extender it's a similar process go to the physical device and press the power button on the side when it's plugged in press and hold that factory reset button hit the power to turn it back on and again hold it for about 20 seconds it's going to take a bit to go through the initial boot from there you can let go and it'll reset that individual device if you're on a large network with a lot of devices and you want to factory reset by hand to reset the whole network you will want to unplug all of your access points once the aps have been reset to factory default reset the mesh extenders in most cases it's going to be easier to do this through the web user interface go to primary AP tools and then configuration management reset the primary AP to factory defaults go into the web user interface under the monitoring access points menu and reset each access point and mesh extender other than your current primary AP this gets everything back to factory default state it's as simple as that now you know how to clear everything and start from scratch thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

I will select xg1 and xg2 ports for stacking and I will configure unit ID after reset as to on the second switch so it will be the standby next move back to switch 1. navigate to the administration menu and select stack management here also I'll select the stack mode as native stacking the stack topology is chain and the stack active is unit 1. I'll choose the xg1 and xg2 ports for stacking and choose unit ID after reset as one from the drop down menu so it will be the active switch reboot switch 1 by clicking the apply and reboot button click OK on the pop-up notification window to confirm the reboot do the same for switch 2. the switches will take some time to reboot and form a stack once the reboot is done log into switch 1 the active switch navigate to the status and statistics menu on the system summary page scroll down here you can see that the stack has been formed unit 1 is active and unit 2 is on standby exactly what I wanted I'll move the mouse pointer over the xg1 and xg2 ports on both switches here you can see that they show as stack ports now I'll navigate to the port management menu to see that the xg1 and xg2 ports are not showing as Network ports now for unit 2 you can see those details as well now that everything is set click on the blinking red icon on top of the screen to save the configuration that's it you are now running your switches as a stack enjoy the benefits they provide thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

configure your wireless local area networks wlans you'll be happy to know that with the latest CBD firmware update 2.5 there are some new beneficial options available for Cisco business wireless devices these helpful features can be configured and monitored through CBD as long as the wlans were created through the CBD dashboard in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll do a quick review of previous Wireless configuration options as well as explain the new firmware version 2.5 enhanced Wireless features on Cisco business dashboard I'll start with the network configuration of Wireless Lans beginning with the setup of a WLAN profile this is an easy way to deploy wireless networks to a large number of access points on the network you can edit an existing WLAN profile or add a new one for example I'll add a WLAN profile too and have it as part of my default organization you'll need to decide what groups of devices this applies to here you can specify the group of devices and move them over you could add additional wlans I'll create a CPD test WLAN specify what VLAN it's going to be on and what security it's going to be using I'll select WPA2 and wpa3 personal as it provides a more secure connection than earlier versions here you can specify some advanced settings will you be broadcasting this SSID so your network is easy to find or do you want to keep it hidden do you want visibility into applications being accessed are you looking at local profiling to see what types of clients are connected and finally what radios are broadcasting once everything is entered hit save and then save again this would apply to the device groups you've applied it to in this example I don't have it applying to device groups so right now it's not pushing this out to all of my devices I can change this at any time if you go to wireless radios you can set up wireless radio profiles this allows you to specify some overall radio settings for a group of devices or throughout your organization from here you can add a profile name I'll call this my CBD profile specify the organization and the groups of devices that you're using if you're on a live Network as is my case I won't apply it to a group of systems yet because I don't want to kick people off of the network that are currently using it I'll wait to do this once office hours are over you can specify some settings here such as enabling radio frequency RF optimization this can help your wireless network acquire a better signal when there are competing networks in the area you'll note these settings look very similar to what you see on the web user interface of the Cisco business wireless cbw devices if you have the older WAP models they'll still work fine they just don't have the additional features that are available on the cbw models so specifically on your cbw devices you can say if it is a low medium or high density Network and specify the data types you're using for prioritization of data you can have Rogue AP detection enabled or disabled if enabled this feature detects devices that do not belong to your company do you want to have it detect causes of interference like electromagnetic signals or other physical obstacles if so enable interference detection once you've made your selections save your new settings you may not want to apply it to all devices but you can [Music] this configuration option allows you to customize things on a sort of macro level to a large number of devices you also now have the ability to customize settings on an access point by access point basis these are some nice simple yet Advanced configuration options you can go to an individual access point and either pull it up by going into your organization finding the access point and hitting the more button or go to inventory to find this particular device and pull it up through there once you're connected you can find the dashboard with other information about this you can go through and look at the wireless Lans and see the radio configurations you can view the channel it's using to transmit power the Channel width as well as the standard things you might want to customize now you can go in and make changes for example you could move this from Channel 11 to channel 6. on the 2.4 gigahertz band as you can see there are no Associated clients connected on the 2.4 gigahertz band on this AP so you could save this and not worry about kicking anybody off the network you can customize these radio channels transmit power and more you have the ability to change things without having to connect to the web UI for each device or the web UI for the cbw primary AP on each Network when customizing this you simply go through and find these devices in your inventory list and tweak them as appropriate there you have it a quick overview of some of the helpful wireless settings that have been updated in CBD version 2.5 thanks for watching I'll see you next time",

either way it needs to get where it's going as fast as possible it needs priority so you immediately pull over to give them a clear path to their destination on a network quality of service or qos settings can give priority to certain types of traffic that shouldn't be delayed in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to restrict internet bandwidth for a group of users using qos on Cisco rv340 series routers next to start the configuration log into the router provide the username and password and click login navigate to Lan and then VLAN settings to create a separate VLAN for the users for which you want to restrict the internet bandwidth now click add under the VLAN table to add a new VLAN notice that VLAN 2 has been created the IP address is 192.168.2.1 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 next enable the DHCP server you can see the IP address range start and IP address range end for the DHCP server we are enabling for VLAN 2. users connecting to VLAN 2 will get the IP automatically from that IP address range to save the settings click apply VLAN 2 has now been created moving on configure Portland 2 for untagged traffic on VLAN 2. select untagged traffic for VLAN 2 on Portland 2 by clicking edit as a result any PC or laptop can be connected to this support to verify the service untag the traffic on this port since the PC laptop or network interface card cannot process the tagged VLAN traffic click apply to save the changes as you can see VLAN 2 traffic on Portland 2 is untagged so any system can connect to verify this service next navigate to qos and select the traffic classes option to configure the traffic classes traffic classes Channel internet traffic to the desired queue based on the service the service can be layer 4 TCP or UDP Port application Source or destination IP address dscp receive interface OS and device type move over to the traffic table and click add enter the class name as VLAN 2 and 2 underscore VLAN 2 for the description navigate to the service table click add and enter the service name field as two underscore VLAN 2 and Wan 1 as receive interface this is the activewan interface on the router choose ipv4 as the IP version The Source IP will remain as any and the destination IP will remain as VLAN 2. next enter 255.255.255.0 as the subnet mask for the network service application select all traffic from the drop down menu the device type and Os type are not editable so they will stay as any keep the match dscp as any and the rewrite dscp as none click apply to save the settings next to create the traffic class from VLAN 2 to WAN traffic click add under service table and enter the class name as Wan provide the description as to when I will also use the service name as to Wan for the receive interface enter VLAN 2 and ipv4 for the IP version set the source IP to 192.168.2.0 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 for the VLAN 2 Network the destination IP will be set to any value in this case 0.0.0.0 [Music] the service application will be set to all traffic and the device type will be set to any to finish this task click apply to save next navigate to qos and then wan queuing to specify the queuing engine there are three different modes priority rate control and low latency which are mutually exclusive select rate control so that you can Define the minimum and maximum rate for each queue under the WAN queuing table click add to add the queuing policy in the policy name field enter rate underscore VLAN 2 and VLAN 2 for the description under the queuing rate control table select the traffic class for q1 from the drop down menu I will go with Wan and keep the minimum and maximum rates at one percent for this scenario I've limited the internet bandwidth to 10 megabits per second here the capacity of the WAN is one gigabit per second or 1000 megabits per second limiting the maximum rate to one percent or the bandwidth to 10 megabits per second click apply to save the changes these settings May differ from the ones that were just configured it in the bandwidth restriction you want to apply to your network the rate control policy is now visible here next navigate to qos and then when policing in when policing the rate control mode supports eight cues each queue can be configured with a maximum rate for q1 choose VLAN 2 for the traffic class and reduce the maximum rate to one percent to restrict the traffic to 10 megabits per second this is one percent of one gigabit per second which means one thousand megabits per second click apply to save the changes make sure that you have enabled Wan policing for the WAN interfaces as well as a result check the box and then click apply to save the changes the next step is configuring the WAN bandwidth management policy that will be applied to the outbound queuing policy navigate to qos and then Wan bandwidth management the WAN interfaces can be configured with a maximum bandwidth that is provided by your internet service provider when the value or transfer rate in kilobits per second is configured the traffic entering the interface is saved at that defined rate in this section I'll Define the maximum bandwidth provided by your internet service provider or ISP for both the WAN interface and the activewan interface keep the upstream and the downstream traffic for the WAN 1 interface at 10 million kilobits per second which is the maximum capacity for the WAN 1 interface on this router your value May differ depending on the internet bandwidth you use and the WAN bandwidth restrictions you wish to impose I'll select the outbound queuing policy from the drop down as rate underscore VLAN 2 for the wan1 interface the active interface however in your case you may apply for both the WAN interface and any other interface where you want to restrict the bandwidth once you finalize the settings click apply to save the changes now you can see that the changes have been applied you can check when policing to see if it is enabled when the WAN queuing policy is applied to the wan1 interface you can see it in the WAN queuing table navigate to the traffic classes to verify that the traffic class VLAN 2 and Wan are in use to save this configuration to the router's Startup configuration file click on the red blinking save icon this will take you to the configuration management page where you can see that the source is set to running configuration and the destination is set to Startup configuration to save the settings click apply you will get a success notification pop-up on the screen click ok the configuration has been successfully completed and saved you can now test the bandwidth restrictions by connecting your PC or laptop to VLAN 2. these settings keep priority data moving efficiently where it needs to go just like that ambulance thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

least similarly when a destination address is not known broadcast messages get sent out and the network data can get stuck in a loop this uses precious resources and the data doesn't reach its destination this can be even more problematic when stacking switches in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to prevent Loops using the spanning tree protocol STP on three or more Cisco business switches STP is an essential Network protocol used to prevent looping within a network topology as you can see here this network diagram shows a simple network with two switches and two computers when the switches are connected with one cable it can be a point of failure so to ensure that the network has a better chance of staying up and running you can add a second cable this adds some redundancy which is good however this can create Loops in this example if computer 1 sends an address resolution protocol ARP request looking for computer 2. switch 1 will send out a broadcast on all interfaces except where it was received from computer one this means switch 2 will see both broadcast frames so switch 2 will receive one of the broadcast frames on Port 1 and will send it out to Port 2. likewise the frames received on Port 2 will be sent on Port 1. the other switch will behave in the same manner back and forth forming a loop the packets will continue going back and forth until you either disconnect one of the cables or one of the switches crashes overwhelmed with all the traffic that's coming back STP will help the network become free of loops let me show you how this happens this diagram shows three connected switches to keep things simple I have labeled the Mac addresses as AAA Triple B and Triple C without stb without STP there would be Loops however as a default setting on CBS switches STP is enabled therefore special frames called Bridge protocol data units bpdus will be sent to each other this Frame contains the MAC address and priority called a bridge ID spanning tree requires this bridge ID for its calculation of the root Bridge a root Bridge is a focal point in the network all other decisions such as which port to Black and which port to put in forwarding mode are made from the perspective of this root Bridge to see the spanning tree settings log into the switch and navigate to spanning tree under STP status and global settings make sure the spanning tree state is enabled STP loopback guard is not enabled by default this feature provides additional protection against layer 2 forwarding Loops regarding not receiving BPD use if enabled it can cause more traffic congestion on the switch I'll leave it disabled the STP operation mode is set to Classic STP but there are other options available you can check out the CBS admin guide for more information on these options the bpdu handling is grayed out and set to flooding you cannot change this when spanning tree is enabled is when packets go out to all the switches if you disabled spanning tree you will then have the option to select flooding or filtering this means the bpdus are only going to get forwarded or filtered this is not recommended next default value is in Long mode by default but you also have the option to select short this refers to the 16 or 32-bit value that provides for the speed of the interfaces the long version can account for more options if the speed increases under bridge settings is the priority the default value is 32 768. the hello time has a default of two seconds which means a bpdu is sent that often the max age is set to 20 seconds if you do not receive a bpdu for this time frame you will know something has changed in the network and you'll need to recheck the topology forward delay is the timer used for the listening and learning states of the port it will remain in each state for a duration of 15 seconds now that you know the location for the STP settings on the web UI of the Switch I'll go back to the network diagram to see what STP will do with the bridge ID so taking the bridge IDs into consideration it will elect a root Bridge the switch with the lowest Bridge ID is preferred as a quick reminder 32 768 is the default priority number on all three switches if this is the case then the MAC address will be taken into consideration meaning the switch with the lowest Mac address will become the root Bridge in this simple Network diagram it's AAA therefore switch 1 will become the root Bridge the ports on the root Bridge are always designated on this diagram the letter D represents that the switch is in a forwarding state the other two switches can be referred to as the non-root ridges if you need to find the root Port the shortest path to the root bridge take a look at the speed of the interface each interface has a certain cost the path with the lowest cost will be used here's a quick overview of the interfaces and their costs the ge1 interface on switch 2 and 3 will be the root ports now you know the designated ports on the root bridge and the root ports on non-root Bridges however a loop still exists so you need to shut down a port between switch 2 and switch 3 to break that Loop for this scenario ge2 on switch 3 needs to be shut down both switches have the same priorities but Triple B is the lower Mac address to shut down the switch you can block its Port which will break the loop a labeled here stands for the alternate or non-designated port it's blocked now that the port is shut down the loop problem is solved ge2 of switch 2 will be in a forward State designated as d if you look at the designated route settings in the web interface of the switch the bridge ID and the root Bridge ID will both be AAA as switch a is the root Bridge the root port and the root path cost will both be zero because that information is for the non-root switches which are leading to the bridge if you look at switch 2 the bridge ID will be Triple B and the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the MAC address of the root Bridge switch one the root Port will be the port that leads to the root Bridges it's going to be interface one and the root path cost will be four because this is a 1000 megabits per second speed finally if you look at switch 3 the bridge ID will be the MAC address Triple C the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the root Port again will be 1 and the root path cost will be four when you navigate to STP interface settings in the web UI of the switch you can see more information on the port and edit it if needed the table shows the interface and if STP is enabled or disabled on it edgeport status is displayed and this enables or disables the fast link on the port if fastlink mode is enabled on a port it automatically sets the forwarding State when the port link is up fastlink therefore optimizes the STP protocol convergence the options for this include enabled disabled or Auto the next column is bpdu handling which is STP the port role can be designated alternate or root ports the table also shows path cost and priority of the port by default it's set at 128. the port State displays the current STP state of the port it can be disabled blocking listening learning or forwarding and then there is the designated Bridge ID designated Port ID designated cost and forward transitions you can select one of these interfaces and click on the edit icon to make changes now you know some options for STP and how to configure it on the CBS switches in your network data can get where it needs to go no more loops and no more worries thanks for

that Loop for this scenario ge2 on switch 3 needs to be shut down both switches have the same priorities but Triple B is the lower Mac address to shut down the switch you can block its Port which will break the loop a labeled here stands for the alternate or non-designated port it's blocked now that the port is shut down the loop problem is solved ge2 of switch 2 will be in a forward State designated as d if you look at the designated route settings in the web interface of the switch the bridge ID and the root Bridge ID will both be AAA as switch a is the root Bridge the root port and the root path cost will both be zero because that information is for the non-root switches which are leading to the bridge if you look at switch 2 the bridge ID will be Triple B and the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the MAC address of the root Bridge switch one the root Port will be the port that leads to the root Bridges it's going to be interface one and the root path cost will be four because this is a 1000 megabits per second speed finally if you look at switch 3 the bridge ID will be the MAC address Triple C the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the root Port again will be 1 and the root path cost will be four when you navigate to STP interface settings in the web UI of the switch you can see more information on the port and edit it if needed the table shows the interface and if STP is enabled or disabled on it edgeport status is displayed and this enables or disables the fast link on the port if fastlink mode is enabled on a port it automatically sets the forwarding State when the port link is up fastlink therefore optimizes the STP protocol convergence the options for this include enabled disabled or Auto the next column is bpdu handling which is STP the port role can be designated alternate or root ports the table also shows path cost and priority of the port by default it's set at 128. the port State displays the current STP state of the port it can be disabled blocking listening learning or forwarding and then there is the designated Bridge ID designated Port ID designated cost and forward transitions you can select one of these interfaces and click on the edit icon to make changes now you know some options for STP and how to configure it on the CBS switches in your network data can get where it needs to go no more loops and no more worries thanks for

least similarly when a destination address is not known broadcast messages get sent out and the network data can get stuck in a loop this uses precious resources and the data doesn't reach its destination this can be even more problematic when stacking switches in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to prevent Loops using the spanning tree protocol STP on three or more Cisco business switches STP is an essential Network protocol used to prevent looping within a network topology as you can see here this network diagram shows a simple network with two switches and two computers when the switches are connected with one cable it can be a point of failure so to ensure that the network has a better chance of staying up and running you can add a second cable this adds some redundancy which is good however this can create Loops in this example if computer 1 sends an address resolution protocol ARP request looking for computer 2. switch 1 will send out a broadcast on all interfaces except where it was received from computer one this means switch 2 will see both broadcast frames so switch 2 will receive one of the broadcast frames on Port 1 and will send it out to Port 2. likewise the frames received on Port 2 will be sent on Port 1. the other switch will behave in the same manner back and forth forming a loop the packets will continue going back and forth until you either disconnect one of the cables or one of the switches crashes overwhelmed with all the traffic that's coming back STP will help the network become free of loops let me show you how this happens this diagram shows three connected switches to keep things simple I have labeled the Mac addresses as AAA Triple B and Triple C without stb without STP there would be Loops however as a default setting on CBS switches STP is enabled therefore special frames called Bridge protocol data units bpdus will be sent to each other this Frame contains the MAC address and priority called a bridge ID spanning tree requires this bridge ID for its calculation of the root Bridge a root Bridge is a focal point in the network all other decisions such as which port to Black and which port to put in forwarding mode are made from the perspective of this root Bridge to see the spanning tree settings log into the switch and navigate to spanning tree under STP status and global settings make sure the spanning tree state is enabled STP loopback guard is not enabled by default this feature provides additional protection against layer 2 forwarding Loops regarding not receiving BPD use if enabled it can cause more traffic congestion on the switch I'll leave it disabled the STP operation mode is set to Classic STP but there are other options available you can check out the CBS admin guide for more information on these options the bpdu handling is grayed out and set to flooding you cannot change this when spanning tree is enabled is when packets go out to all the switches if you disabled spanning tree you will then have the option to select flooding or filtering this means the bpdus are only going to get forwarded or filtered this is not recommended next default value is in Long mode by default but you also have the option to select short this refers to the 16 or 32-bit value that provides for the speed of the interfaces the long version can account for more options if the speed increases under bridge settings is the priority the default value is 32 768. the hello time has a default of two seconds which means a bpdu is sent that often the max age is set to 20 seconds if you do not receive a bpdu for this time frame you will know something has changed in the network and you'll need to recheck the topology forward delay is the timer used for the listening and learning states of the port it will remain in each state for a duration of 15 seconds now that you know the location for the STP settings on the web UI of the Switch I'll go back to the network diagram to see what STP will do with the bridge ID so taking the bridge IDs into consideration it will elect a root Bridge the switch with the lowest Bridge ID is preferred as a quick reminder 32 768 is the default priority number on all three switches if this is the case then the MAC address will be taken into consideration meaning the switch with the lowest Mac address will become the root Bridge in this simple Network diagram it's AAA therefore switch 1 will become the root Bridge the ports on the root Bridge are always designated on this diagram the letter D represents that the switch is in a forwarding state the other two switches can be referred to as the non-root ridges if you need to find the root Port the shortest path to the root bridge take a look at the speed of the interface each interface has a certain cost the path with the lowest cost will be used here's a quick overview of the interfaces and their costs the ge1 interface on switch 2 and 3 will be the root ports now you know the designated ports on the root bridge and the root ports on non-root Bridges however a loop still exists so you need to shut down a port between switch 2 and switch 3 to break that Loop for this scenario ge2 on switch 3 needs to be shut down both switches have the same priorities but Triple B is the lower Mac address to shut down the switch you can block its Port which will break the loop a labeled here stands for the alternate or non-designated port it's blocked now that the port is shut down the loop problem is solved ge2 of switch 2 will be in a forward State designated as d if you look at the designated route settings in the web interface of the switch the bridge ID and the root Bridge ID will both be AAA as switch a is the root Bridge the root port and the root path cost will both be zero because that information is for the non-root switches which are leading to the bridge if you look at switch 2 the bridge ID will be Triple B and the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the MAC address of the root Bridge switch one the root Port will be the port that leads to the root Bridges it's going to be interface one and the root path cost will be four because this is a 1000 megabits per second speed finally if you look at switch 3 the bridge ID will be the MAC address Triple C the root Bridge ID will be Triple A the root Port again will be 1 and the root

is just not gonna cut it time to get up and figure out which one needs attention the hunt begins you go from smoke alarm to smoke alarm listening for the next chirp hoping to pinpoint the culprit wouldn't it be great if there were a simple way to show you which one needed the Quick Fix luckily this doesn't need to be a situation you have to deal with on a network you can get important information on devices with link layer Discovery protocol for media endpoint devices also known as lldpmed extension configuration it can be configured on your Cisco business switch this protocol facilitates communication with all the devices in your network data is collected from each device this data includes information that identifies and locates devices including phones on your network in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to configure link layer Discovery protocol for media endpoint devices [Music] thank you when configured on your switch lldp can identify locate and show information about devices in your network if you have a problem with a device you can see its status and location so if needed you can go and work on it directly lldp can be used in networks with both Cisco and non-cisco devices as long as they all support lldp now that you know the benefits I'll dig a little deeper into lldp [Music] lldp is a neighbor Discovery protocol used by network devices to advertise information about themselves to other devices on the network the protocol runs over the data link layer which is how two systems running different network layer protocols learn about each other lldp allows the switch to advertise its identification configuration and capabilities to neighboring devices that store the data in a management information base lldp uses a set of attributes to find and identify neighboring devices the attributes include type length and value descriptions these are called tlvs for short okay now that you know some details about lldp I'll explain lldp Med extension Med is an extension on lldp that operates between endpoint devices such as IP phones and other network devices like switches specifically it provides support for voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP applications Med also provides additional tlvs for capability Discovery Network policy power over ethernet and inventory management and now that you know the basics I'll show you how to configure these lldp Med extensions on your Cisco business switch log into the switch using your username and password change the display mode from basic to Advanced open the VLAN management page to see the vlans on your switch here under VLAN settings you can see the two vlans on my CBS 350 switch VLAN 1 is the default in VLAN 50 is designed for VOIP scroll down the page and Under The Voice VLAN section select properties under the operational status of VLAN 50 check the settings for cos 802.1p which stands for class of service it shows it's configured as five for the voice application here dscp which stands for differentiated Services code point is set to 46. after checking the settings of your VLAN in my case VLAN 50. navigate to the administration menu select Discovery lldp and open the properties page this is how to check the properties of the lldp and make sure it's turned on this page make sure that the lldp status is enabled this page is used to set the general lldp parameters like enabling the features globally and setting timers next navigate to the lldpmed network policy page where you can configure settings for real-time applications including voice and video a couple of points here going forward if a network policy is configured it can be included in the outgoing lldp packets to attached lldp media endpoint device the media endpoint device must send its traffic as specified in the network policy it receives if the lldpmed network policy for voice application is checked it means you can't manually configure these settings as they are set automatically if it is configured how you want then click the apply button in this case I want to define the policy manually so I'll uncheck this auto box the first step to define a new policy is to click the plus icon which then displays this new window labeled add lldpmed Network policy select the network policy as one since it's the first policy you're setting up pick voice from the application drop down menu and then enter the VLAN ID this is where the traffic needs to be sent in this case I'll enter 50. as this VLAN is defined as a voice VLAN on this switch select tagged for the VLAN type which again is for voice traffic user priority or traffic priority is the class of service value to Define next in this case I'll choose 5 for the voice application the next setting is dscp value which is what associates with any application data sent by the neighboring devices in the network this setting tells the neighbors how to Mark the application traffic sent to the device here I'll select 46 as I'm using a voice application at this point the settings are finished click on the apply button here to save the settings to the running configuration file you should see a message on the screen that tells you this new network policy was saved successfully just a note here the interfaces need to be configured manually to include the defined Network policies for the outgoing lldp packets using the lldpmed port settings the next step is to open the lldpmed port settings page so that I can configure the lldp med tlvs if the lldp-med network policy for the voice application is set to Auto and the AutoVoice VLAN 50 is in operation the device automatically generates an lldp-mad Network policy for the voice application for all the lldp ports got the information on this page the user-defined network policy shows that there are two types of traffic defined here active stands for the type of active traffic on the port application means the traffic type for these defined policies and location is where the tlvs are transmitted here Poe which stands for power over ethernet indicates if the poe-psd tlv is transmitted finally inventory shows if the inventory tlv is transmitted the message on the top of the page here shows if the settings are in manual or auto mode and right now this page is in manual mode to change this click on the lldpmed network policy link to open that page here you can select the auto check box and set it to auto mode while in manual mode you can set up and configure additional lldp Med tlvs and one or more user-defined lldp Med Network policies to a port click to select the port and then click on the edit button this page shows all the settings that are available for this port the interface name in this case is ge1 the lldpmed status is enabled right now the SNMP notification is not selected but if you wanted to send smmp notifications on a per Port basis when an Med supported end is discovered click here to enable it the next step is to select the optional tlvs from the ones shown on the left side of this box in this case I'll keep the network policy that's already here for the available Network policies select one voice and then click the right arrow in the middle to move it to the selected Network policies box on the right side there are three fields at the bottom of the page here in each field you need to enter the data in hexadecimal characters these are defined by lldpmed standards each field needs the following information location coordinate enter the coordinate location to be published by lldp location Civic address enter the Civic address to be published by lldp and finally the location ECS Elin which stands for emergency call service and emergency location identification number that will be published by the lldp by default the location is not configured but you can still enter it in hexadecimal format like this today I'm going to leave these fields as they are and then click the apply button again this will save the lldp-mad port settings to the running configuration file you should see the success notification message at the top of the screen this time it also gives a reminder to save the configuration one more check it all looks good close this page and then look at the lldp Port status page to see the global information for every port on the switch one of the things to see here is the ladpmed status for each switch and if it's been enabled don't forget to click on the save icon at the top of the page to save these new settings so there you have it this is how you can view set up and configure the lldpmed extension on your Cisco business switch a great way to keep current information on your devices especially when there is a problem that needs to be addressed

        "transcript": "has this ever happened to you sound asleep only to be woken up by a chirping sound you know that sound it's a smoke alarm with a low battery covering your head with the pillow is just not gonna cut it time to get up and figure out which one needs attention the hunt begins you go from smoke alarm to smoke alarm listening for the next chirp hoping to pinpoint the culprit wouldn't it be great if there were a simple way to show you which one needed the Quick Fix luckily this doesn't need to be a situation you have to deal with on a network you can get important information on devices with link layer Discovery protocol for media endpoint devices also known as lldpmed extension configuration it can be configured on your Cisco business switch this protocol facilitates communication with all the devices in your network data is collected from each device this data includes information that identifies and locates devices including phones on your network in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how to configure link layer Discovery protocol for media endpoint devices [Music] thank you when configured on your switch lldp can identify locate and show information about devices in your network if you have a problem with a device you can see its status and location so if needed you can go and work on it directly lldp can be used in networks with both Cisco and non-cisco devices as long as they all support lldp now that you know the benefits I'll dig a little deeper into lldp [Music] lldp is a neighbor Discovery protocol used by network devices to advertise information about themselves to other devices on the network the protocol runs over the data link layer which is how two systems running different network layer protocols learn about each other lldp allows the switch to advertise its identification configuration and capabilities to neighboring devices that store the data in a management information base lldp uses a set of attributes to find and identify neighboring devices the attributes include type length and value descriptions these are called tlvs for short okay now that you know some details about lldp I'll explain lldp Med extension Med is an extension on lldp that operates between endpoint devices such as IP phones and other network devices like switches specifically it provides support for voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP applications Med also provides additional tlvs for capability Discovery Network policy power over ethernet and inventory management and now that you know the basics I'll show you how to configure these lldp Med extensions on your Cisco business switch log into the switch using your username and password change the display mode from basic to Advanced open the VLAN management page to see the vlans on your switch here under VLAN settings you can see the two vlans on my CBS 350 switch VLAN 1 is the default in VLAN 50 is designed for VOIP scroll down the page and Under The Voice VLAN section select properties under the operational status of VLAN 50 check the settings for cos 802.1p which stands for class of service it shows it's configured as five for the voice application here dscp which stands for differentiated Services code point is set to 46. after checking the settings of your VLAN in my case VLAN 50. navigate to the administration menu select Discovery lldp and open the properties page this is how to check the properties of the lldp and make sure it's turned on this page make sure that the lldp status is enabled this page is used to set the general lldp parameters like enabling the features globally and setting timers next navigate to the lldpmed network policy page where you can configure settings for real-time applications including voice and video a couple of points here going forward if a network policy is configured it can be included in the outgoing lldp packets to attached lldp media endpoint device the media endpoint device must send its traffic as specified in the network policy it receives if the lldpmed network policy for voice application is checked it means you can't manually configure these settings as they are set automatically if it is configured how you want then click the apply button in this case I want to define the policy manually so I'll uncheck this auto box the first step to define a new policy is to click the plus icon which then displays this new window labeled add lldpmed Network policy select the network policy as one since it's the first policy you're setting up pick voice from the application drop down menu and then enter the VLAN ID this is where the traffic needs to be sent in this case I'll enter 50. as this VLAN is defined as a voice VLAN on this switch select tagged for the VLAN type which again is for voice traffic user priority or traffic priority is the class of service value to Define next in this case I'll choose 5 for the voice application the next setting is dscp value which is what associates with any application data sent by the neighboring devices in the network this setting tells the neighbors how to Mark the application traffic sent to the device here I'll select 46 as I'm using a voice application at this point the settings are finished click on the apply button here to save the settings to the running configuration file you should see a message on the screen that tells you this new network policy was saved successfully just a note here the interfaces need to be configured manually to include the defined Network policies for the outgoing lldp packets using the lldpmed port settings the next step is to open the lldpmed port settings page so that I can configure the lldp med tlvs if the lldp-med network policy for the voice application is set to Auto and the AutoVoice VLAN 50 is in operation the device automatically generates an lldp-mad Network policy for the voice application for all the lldp ports got the information on this page the user-defined network policy shows that there are two types of traffic defined here active stands for the type of active traffic on the port application means the traffic type for these defined policies and location is where the tlvs are transmitted here Poe which stands for power over ethernet indicates if the poe-psd tlv is transmitted finally inventory shows if the inventory tlv is transmitted the message on the top of the page here shows if the settings are in manual or auto mode and right now this page is in manual mode to change this click on the lldpmed network policy link to open that page here you can select the auto check box and set it to auto mode while in manual mode you can set up and configure additional lldp Med tlvs and one or more user-defined lldp Med Network policies to a port click to select the port and then click on the edit button this page shows all the settings that are available for this port the interface name in this case is ge1 the lldpmed status is enabled right now the SNMP notification is not selected but if you wanted to send smmp notifications on a per Port basis when an Med supported end is discovered click here to enable it the next step is to select the optional tlvs from the ones shown on the left side of this box in this case I'll keep the network policy that's already here for the available Network policies select one voice and then click the right arrow in the middle to move it to the selected Network policies box on the right side there are three fields at the bottom of the page here in each field you need to enter the data in hexadecimal characters these are defined by lldpmed standards each field needs the following information location coordinate enter the coordinate location to be published by lldp location Civic address enter the Civic address to be published by lldp and finally the location ECS Elin which stands for emergency call service and emergency location identification number that will be published by the lldp by default the location is not configured but you can still enter it in hexadecimal format like this today I'm going to leave these fields as they are and then click the apply button again this will save the lldp-mad port settings to the running configuration file you should see the success notification message at the top of the screen this time it also gives a reminder to save the configuration one more check it all looks good close this page and then look at the lldp Port status page to see the global information for every port on the switch one of the things to see here is the ladpmed status for each switch and if it's been enabled don't forget to click on the save icon at the top of the page to save these new settings so there you have it this is how you can view set up and configure the lldpmed extension on your Cisco business switch a great way to keep current information on your devices especially when there is a problem that needs to be addressed thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

routes are based on media access control Mac address tables Mac address tables can be learned dynamically and can also be created with static entries in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll explain how Mac address tables are created on a Cisco business series switch I'll start by explaining how a Mac table is created dynamically in this scenario there are three computers connected to a switch for Simplicity I have labeled the Mac addresses AAA Triple B and Triple C the switch is new so the MAC address table is blank to start the computer with the MAC address of AAA sends a frame to the computer with a Mac address of Triple B when the switch receives the frame it adds the MAC address of the sender AAA as well as the interface on which the frame was received the switch doesn't know the Final Destination yet since the only entry in the MAC address table is the sending device therefore the switch floods the frame out all other ports trying to reach the destination foreign the devices that don't have that destination Mac address don't accept the frames so in this example the computer with the MAC address of Triple C will reject the frame the computer with a Mac address of Triple B will accept the frame and send back a reply through the switch the switch adds the Triple B Mac address and Associated interface to the table moving forward while that address is in the table any frames for Triple B will be sent directly there this is how the MAC address table is populated dynamically if you want to see your current Dynamic Mac address table navigate to the web user interface of the switch select the MAC address tables menu and scroll down to Dynamic addresses here you will see a list along with some options for privacy part of each Mac address has been blurred however you can still see the interface in VLAN ID that are associated with them if you want to erase the entire Mac address list all at once select the clear table option you can search by Mac address if you want to view a specific one the dynamic Mac address table isn't permanent after a certain period of inactivity the entries are cleared the default value for this is 300 seconds but can be adjusted to any number between 10 and 400. so if you want the MAC address to be refreshed more frequently decrease the time alternatively by increasing the Aging time the Mac addresses will be retained for a longer period to change this scroll up and click on Dynamic address settings for this example I'll leave it alone the basics for dynamic Mac address tables next I'll move on to static Mac address tables static Mac address tables are manually entered and always take precedence over Dynamic they're usually configured as a security measure to prevent layer 2 spoofing attacks a spoofing attack is when a hacker spoofs or falsifies a MAC address to change entries in the MAC address table with the goal of gaining access to data in this example if a static entry doesn't exist for the MAC address AAA a hacker could spoof that Mac address and send a packet to the MAC address of Triple B as a result the switch would update the MAC address table with the new interface number packets for AAA would be sent to the new location to illustrate the table now shows the MAC address for AAA connected to interface 3 instead of interface 1. if you use a static Mac address then you can make sure that the MAC address is only available on a certain interface or port to add a static Mac address entry return to the switch web user interface on the left hand side navigate to the MAC address tables menu and select a static address click on the blue plus button specify the MAC address and the interface or port you can also specify a VLAN ID here I'll enter VLAN 1 since it is the

when it comes to business if a network goes down business productivity comes to a halt therefore it's considered a best practice to save a backup configuration for every device this way if your network starts having problems you can use that backup this saves you the time of performing a factory reset and configuring the device from scratch in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to backup and update configuration files for your Cisco business switch to start log into the switch by entering the username and password click login navigate to administration file management and then file operations as you can see on this page there are three operation types to select so you can update a file backup a file or duplicate a file select duplicate these three options will automatically appear on the screen running configuration which is the file currently running on the switch Startup configuration which is the file the switch uses to start up after reboot and finally mirror configuration which is a copy of the Startup configuration file that's made when the switch has been operating continuously for 24 hours without any changes to the running configuration file when you select the source file to duplicate you'll then see what the options are this is called the destination file name as you can see here if running configuration is checked as a source file the only option for the destination file is Startup configuration if you select Startup configuration as the source file then the only option is running configuration however if you select mirror configuration both running and Startup configuration files are available to be the output for this example I'm going to select the option to duplicate the running configuration file as Startup configuration and then click apply at the top of the screen when the operation is done there should be a success notification at the top of the screen as well as two syslog notification messages that show what I did and that it was done successfully it's pretty simple isn't it now I'll show you how to backup a file on your switch the backup file operation gives you options to select which file you can save as a backup and then copy to another device the source file types that can be backed up are running configuration Startup configuration mirror configuration logging file and dashboard info file for this example I'll choose Startup configuration as the source file I want to back up next you need to choose the copy method right now you can see I'm in basic mode use the drop down to change it to Advanced and you can see all available copy methods HTTP https a USB drive an internal Flash tftp which means trivial file transfer protocol or SCP file transfer via SSH which means secure copy protocol foreign I'll use the HTTP or https option and then choose how to handle any sensitive data in the file click exclude and no sensitive data will be included in the backup if encrypt is selected the sensitive data in the file is included but encrypted to keep it safe if I choose plain text the backup copy will contain all the sensitive data in the backup but only as plain text I'll select plain text and then click apply as you can see the downloaded file is now showing up on the screen as a text file with the name startup-config.txt and again I get the notification that the process was a success along with syslog notification pop-ups as you can see here all I have to do now is go to my downloads folder to get this file and use it to restore the switch configuration lastly I'll show you how to update files click update file notice that there are three destination file types to choose from for this example I'm going to update the Startup configuration file that I just backed up and downloaded earlier I can choose any of the methods available here to copy but today I'll use the HTTP https method to keep it simple if I choose other options then I'll need to configure additional parameters after selecting the file to be updated I now need to go to the location of that file to find it browse for the file by clicking browse next to file name navigate to the downloads folder select the file I previously downloaded and click open and then finally apply when it's done you'll see that success note at the top of the screen and again the syslog notifications on the bottom right which tells you that it was successful notice the red blinking save icon at the top of the screen this is pointing out that there was a change to the configuration file and it needs to be saved it's like it's waving at me and saying hey there don't forget to save the changes you just made so click on that save icon and again you see the success and syslock notifications to let me know everything worked fine now that the Startup configuration file has been replaced you need to reboot the switch to finish the process navigate to the reboot option in the administration panel and click the reboot button to confirm you want to reboot click the OK button and the switch will begin to reboot it takes some time to reboot but eventually the login page will show up go ahead and log in again navigate to status statistics and open the system summary page when you look at system uptime you should see that it's only been up for a few minutes which means the reboot was successful and has just been turned on see that flashing red save icon again at the top of the page go ahead and click on it again to save the newly updated configuration file and you'll see the success in syslog notifications that's how simple it is to make a backup configuration file and then update it on The Cisco business switch as well thanks for watching I'll see you next time

        "transcript": "have you ever had your computer crash and you lost all the files you needed for a big project I have and let me tell you it's a nightmare but from that experience I learned to store copies on an external hard drive or another safe location now that I have planned ahead I can rest easy in that same way networks can be unpredictable so a backup for the configuration of your Cisco business wireless cbw access point can really save the day planning for it just in case doesn't take long gives you security and can be a big Time Saver down the road in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll show you how to back up and restore the configuration of your cbw access points start by logging into your access point by entering the username and password click sign in navigate to Advanced and then click on the primary AP tools option once you're on the primary AP tools page go to the configuration management tab here under the config update section you have the option to upload and download your configuration of the cbw AP at any point you can export the current primary AP configuration to a text format when saving a backup configuration it's important to back up the most recent working configuration of the access point to do that simply choose the direction as download from the drop down menu and select HTTP as the transfer mode then when you click apply a pop-up window will appear click yes to confirm that you want to download the configuration file by default the file is saved as a config text file in the downloads folder of your PC it's as simple as that alternatively if you want to import a configuration from a previously saved configuration file select upload for the direction field under transfer mode the options include HTTP SFTP FTP and tftp if you select SFTP FTP or tftp then you must enter the mandatory parameters like file path file name and IP address as you can see you also have the option to perform Imports on a regular basis to set this you enable the schedule update toggle and then configure the frequency the frequency options are once hourly weekly or monthly after you specify the date and time just click apply by default the schedule update option is disabled on the cbwap [Music] for this example I'll use the HTTP option to transfer the file once you click apply a pop-up window will appear click browse to locate the configuration file from the downloads folder after selecting the file simply click open and then click yes as you can see the import process will start be patient it takes a few minutes to upgrade the configuration as a reminder the import will cause all the primary capable access points in the network to reboot when the access points come back online the primary AP election process takes place the primary AP comes back online with the newly imported configuration once the reboot process completes go ahead and log into your access point Again by entering the username and password click sign in did you know that it is also possible to download and upload the configuration file of an individual access point or mesh extender to do that navigate to monitoring and under Network summary click on access points here you can view the table listing the primary capable AP primary AP and mesh extenders in your network select any device from the list and scroll down the page for this example I've selected the mesh extender under the tools tab you can see the export config and import config options to download the running configuration of the mesh extender simply click the export config button the configuration will get downloaded as a text file simple and easy by default the configuration file is saved to the downloads folder of your PC the name will show as the ap's MAC address underscore config text file if you want to be extra safe you can save it to an external hard drive as well these export and import options are available for the primary AP as well as all the aps associated with the primary AP the mandatory configurations of an AP are exported this includes information on General details radio details mesh extenders mode details ethernet bridging and vlans you can use this file to restore the access point even after a factory reset using the import config option you can upload the configuration file in a text format to do this you need to click the browse button to locate the configuration file select the file click open and then click yes once the configuration has been applied successfully you will see a notification in the web UI of your AP it's important to note that non-mesh AP configuration files should not be imported to mesh deployment APS also after uploading the configuration to the AP it normally takes one to two minutes to take effect you may notice that the LED of the AP will change from solid or blinking green to blinking Amber while the configuration is being applied it goes back to blinking green once the upload is complete that's it you know all you need to know to make sure your cbw AP configuration is backed up and will be there for a restore if needed now it's up to you to stay on top of it thanks for watching I'll see you

        "transcript": "many businesses use a virtual private Network a VPN so employees can access company resources while away from the office pretty typical but sometimes access requirements get a little more complicated like what if your employees need VPN access to two different sites can it be done you bet you just need a client to cite VPN and a site to site VPN this configuration will eliminate the need for setting up the client-to-site VPN configuration on both routers instead there will be two remote networks in my example a home network and an rv340w office network will be used are you ready to take on this challenge let me get you on your way in this episode of Cisco tech talk I'll guide you through the configurations needed for a client to connect to two different sites using the rv340w router I'll begin by creating an ipsec profile this profile will be used to configure the encryption for the layer 2 tunneling protocol lttp VPN to create a profile navigate to the ipsec profile table and click the plus icon enter a profile name I'll Select Auto for the keying mode and Ike version 1 for the ike version to select the diffie-hellman DH group click on group 2-1024 bit although there are different encryption levels select triple Des use sha-1 as the authentication method to connect the VPN and set the essay lifetime for Phase 1 to 86 400. for Phase 2 select ESP for the protocol selection and triple Des for the encryption next use sha1 as the authentication method and set the essay lifetime to 28 800. disable perfect forward secrecy these encryption levels were selected because they are compatible with Microsoft's built-in VPN to see a list of recommended settings check out the site keep in mind that Cisco does not support these third-party sites they are shown for your reference if you change any of these settings the VPN will fail to connect and nobody wants that to keep moving along you will need to create a user group that contains the clients that will establish a client-to-site VPN connection after creating a group create user accounts for each member add the newly created group to this account the number of accounts is based on the number of users a unique username and password are required for each user to use the VPN additionally ensure that the service auth sequence for lttp is configured notice that the primary authentication method for lttp is automatically set to radius in the server off sequence change that to the local database for the secondary choose radius here the router will not accept the none option the local database should be set as the primary which is where the VPN client authentications will be sent to now verify the changes were applied to the service auth sequence for the lttp server once confirmed you can move on to the configuration of the ltp VPN to enable the lttp server select the on checkbox the IP address is essential this IP pool range must be distinct from the client and router Networks this will be added to the IP group later as it is the network for the VPN add a DNS server Lan IP address of the router and then a second DNS server address of 8.8.8.8 this is a well-known Google server make sure to add the ltp group you previously created to activate the ipsec profile select the profile that was just created and input a secure pre-shared key click apply to save your changes to create the client's site use the built-in VPN in Windows start by selecting add and provide a name for the connection the server's name or address will be your remote router's public IP address assigned on the WAN interface Additionally you can specify an fqdn if you have one select ltp with a pre-shared key as the VPN type afterward enter the pre-shared key configured earlier click save select the newly created adapter click on properties then security make sure that these Protocols are allowed if you choose Microsoft Chat version 2 the VPN will not be able to connect so choose Pap click on it and then click ok great the basic setup on that end is complete moving on you need to create the site-to-site VPN between the home network and the rv340w network therefore you need to create local groups and give them a name it's important to know your local network as well as the network of your lttp as both these networks will be added to the IP group choose an IP address subnet so that all addresses in that subnet are accessible via the site to site VPN to begin enter the address of the home router in this example 192.168.1.0 24. this enables the VPN to connect to all IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0 network you can also specify an IP address if you want to allow only one IP address to connect to the VPN or even an IP address range in this example the type is subnet the device type and the operating system type will be any next add the subnet of the VPN in this case 10.25.25.0 24. this is the subnet for the lttp VPN that was just created these options allow all IP addresses in that subnet to connect to the VPN to save the ipgroup settings click apply great that part is set moving on it's time to configure the site to site VPN to begin go to the site to site VPN menu and select add check the box next to add edit a new connection enter the connection name and choose the default ipsec profile if there is already a custom profile select it what matters here is that both ends of the VPN the home network and the rv340w network use the same ipsec profile then choose the interface with an internet connection that would be Wan 1 in this case the remote endpoint will be assigned a static IP address thereafter enter the pre-shared key although it isn't recommended you can disable the minimum pre-shared key complexity if you choose select a specific IP address as the local identifier type to keep this simple and secure choose local fqdn the local identifier can be anything but it must contain a DOT I'll keep my local identifier as router.vpn for Simplicity then as the local IP type select the IP group defined earlier this determines which local networks can connect to the VPN in this instance 192.168.1.0 is the network address of my local router Additionally the ltp VPN network 10.25.25.0 is included in this IP group next choose fqdn again for the remote identifier an arbitrary name for Simplicity in this example I'll use remote.vpn as the remote identifier the remote IP type can be a single IP address a subnet or a set of IP addresses this defines who will be permitted to connect to the VPN from a remote location [Music] if I choose an IP address I will only be able to Define one if I choose IP group all devices in that IP group will be allowed regardless of their IP address after that select a subnet this will allow you to connect to a VPN enabled subnet enter the rv340w Network's subnet and type in the subnet mask then under advanced settings enable both the keep alive and dead peer detection options both of these options will Aid in the maintenance of the VPN connection if one side loses connectivity the VPN should automatically attempt to re-establish the connection not let the home network router has been configured you can configure the rb340w network first create an IP address group and designate it as a remote group this group will contain the remote networks that will be allowed through the VPN including my home network following that enter the 192.168.1.0 address and the 10.25.25.0 for the lttp VPN IP subnet next proceed to the VPN configuration here you will want to ensure that the VPN is activated Additionally the ipsec profiles must match on both sides leave this as the default the interface should be where your internet connection is the remote endpoint should be the other end's static IP address or fqdn next use the static IP address assigned to the home network then enter the pre-shared key this should be the same as what you specified in the other end for the router site-to-site configuration use the same options for the local group identifier as you did for the first site to site VPN so choose local fqdn and name this remote.vpn notice here that remote.vpn was the remote identifier for the site to site VPN configured on the home network router it has now been designated as the local identifier and as a result it is reversed connect to the same subnet that the rv340w network is on in this case the router's local group configuration should match the home Network router's remote group they are once again reversed configure the remote group setup next this should correspond to the local group configured in the home network router select remote fqdn as the remote identifier type and enter the remote identifier router.vpn followed by the IP group this is the IP group that I've just created after this navigate to advanced settings and ensure that both keep alive and dpd are selected as a result I can now see my site to site VPN is connected after that try to Ping from the client's site ping the home network first take note that the Ping was successful here ping the rb340w network to continue ping is a success from the client site you can connect to both routers as a result the client now has access to both routers the rb340w network router and the home network router this is accomplished by connecting the client to the home network router via an lttp VPN additionally a site-to-site VPN connection was established between the home network router and the rv340w network router add the network of your lttp VPN as well as the local network to the IP group this granted site-to-site VPN access to the lttatp VPN client the Alta TP VPN client now has a connection to both the home network and the rv340w network all set your clients can access both network resources while they work remotely thanks for watching I'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "when you operate a business out of your home a switch can be like the electricity powering your home essential an unmanaged switch can be a valuable cost-effective solution for making your office network successful let's talk about these options and finding the right unmanaged switch for your needs [Music] so let's walk through the basics say you run a small home office in this case an unmanaged switch is how you might make the devices on your network desktop computers printers wireless access points ip phones etc effectively talk to one another if this scenario matches yours you should consider an unmanaged switch for your network so what other criteria best describes an ideal candidate for an unmanaged switch well for starters they're ideal for small businesses and home offices on a budget as they're traditionally less expensive than other types of switches and they're perfect for situations where an it person or department are not in the picture they're truly plug and play devices when you have an existing functional network setup if you're working with a small team that needs computers printers security cameras or any other ethernet connected devices to talk to one another an unmanaged switch is potentially an ideal answer for you particularly considering the reliable connection to the network when compared against a wireless access point though wireless devices can provide a convenient on-the-go connection they can encounter interference conversely ethernet wired devices tend to be less susceptible to signal degradation due to interference from competing wireless devices in your office the cisco business 110 series of unmanaged switches are a great place to start they're affordable they can operate at high speeds for bandwidth intensive usage they come with a variety of port configurations depending on how many you anticipate needing for your own networking situation and they're either rack or desktop mountable in addition the ppd 16 pp and 24 pp models are outfitted with power over ethernet capabilities in some of their ports which means you can connect and power compatible devices such as ip phones wireless access points and security cameras with just an ethernet cable keep in mind that not all the ports are poe capable for instance in the 8 port model as many as half the ports can support poe depending on the model so what makes one of these 110 series switches different than the other when it comes to deciding on the best option you'll want to identify your ideal port count whether poe is valuable to your situation and which power supply type makes the most sense for the way your network is set up with a range of 5 to 24 port models usage is scalable depending on the size of your operation if you're a team of 10 with multiple devices allocated per person in addition to shared network devices you might err on the side of the larger port number smaller models such as 5p and 8p are designed to sit comfortably on your desktop while larger port models are designed for convenient rack mounting if you're a single person operation a basic 5 port model might be enough to fit your needs what makes the smallest model the 5td different from the largest the 24pp goes simply beyond the number of ports on the switch increased ports also impact the switch's capacity and speed not to mention the fact that a 5 td can be placed simply on your desktop while a 24pp will require a closet or cabinet to mount so the actual question at hand which model of unmanaged switch is right for you well for instance i run an e-commerce business from my home selling a pretty small amount of inventory and i work with two other teammates we've each got a desktop computer and we share a printer for printing postage as well as iphones and we've got access points set up for ourselves and for guest wi-fi when we host a meeting with third-party vendors so for my home office i use the 8 ppd it has enough ports to meet my device needs power over ethernet capabilities for our access points and phones and i left myself some extra ports that can be used down the road should the business grow when i require them but how about you what do you need to stay connected this video should have given you just the tools you need to get to the bottom of that question just be sure to start with the cisco 110 series of unmanaged switches and you're halfway there thanks for watching this edition of cisco business basics happy networking friends [Music]",

and can change over time in some cases you may want to change a dynamic ip to a static ip address so that it doesn't change this is considered a best practice on switches that handle a lot of network traffic if you need to set access rules firewall rules or make future changes on the switch you will want a static ip on the switch interface in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to convert a cisco business switch cbs 220 250 or 350 dynamic ip address to a static ip address on the vlan 1 interface to begin there are a few settings that need to be configured on the web user interface log into the switch by entering your username and password although the default for both is cisco in all lowercase it is best practice to change the default login credentials enter yours here next navigate to status and statistics and then system summary here you can see the mac address and firmware of the switch a mac address is the unique number associated with a specific piece of equipment the mac address can also be found on the back or the bottom of the switch knowing the mac address will help you find out the dhcp ip address that is connected to that switch [Music] move over to the ipv4 configuration tab and select ipv4 interface in this example the ip address type on the vlan 1 interface is dhcp and the current ip address ends in 1.129 the beginning two octets will be blurred in this video this is to maintain privacy for this network on this switch example the vlan 1 interface is the only one configured to change the ip address check the box in front of vlan 1 and then select the edit icon under ip address type select the static ip address radio button this has made the ip address static instead of dynamic if that's all you need you're set but if you want to change the static ip to a specific static ip address there are a few more steps that need to be performed to show this i'll close and not save the changes still on the ipv4 interface click the add icon leave vlan 1 choose static ip address and add an ip address in this case i'll enter an ip ending in 76.13 enter a prefix length of 24 which is the same as a network mask of 255.255.255.0 but quicker to enter click apply a pop-up will notify you that changing to a static ip address will delete the dynamic ip click ok to continue the add ip interface screen changes that is because the ip address has been changed so you are no longer connected you need to go to the web browser and enter the new ip address that you just configured in this case i'll enter an ip ending in 76.13 once you have entered your ip address you will be brought back to the login screen log in using your credentials and then hit the login button now to confirm these settings navigate to ipv4 configuration and choose ipv4 interface the vlan 1 interface address type is currently set to static and the ip address ends with 76.13 if you're set click on the blinking red save icon to save this configuration if you want to change it to another ip address in the same subnet you have a few options you can delete the entry by clicking on the delete icon wait for a new dynamic ip address to be assigned and then follow the steps we went through earlier [Music] another option is to add another ip address to the same vlan as a static ip it's important to note that if you're trying to add another ip address in the same subnet the switch will not allow it the solution is to add an ip address in a totally different subnet once that has been added you need to change your pc so it is in the same subnet that way they can connect and communicate to do this go into your windows settings under network and internet status settings enter change adapter options click the ethernet port you're using select properties then tcp ipv4 properties set a static ip in the same subnet that was assigned to vlan 1 on the switch the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0 in this case i don't need to enter a default gateway but if you enter one put in the ip address of the switch click ok and ok again to verify this change in the windows search bar enter command prompt and select type ipconfig and hit enter the new ip address is listed here enter the new ip address in a web browser type in your credentials and click log in under ipv4 configuration and then ipv4 interface you will see the two addresses since only one is being used for management you can delete the other one click to select the old ip address and then the delete icon select the plus icon and then static ip address enter an ip address in that original subnet in this example i'll enter an ip ending in 76.15 and the prefix length of 24. click apply then on your windows pc go into settings under network and internet status enter change adapter options click the ethernet port you are using select properties then tcp ipv4 properties change the static ip address back to dhcp click ok this will get your pc a dynamic ip address in the original subnet click ok to verify go into command prompt enter ipconfig again here you will see the ip address listed use that new ip to log into the switch by entering the ip address in the web browser from here enter your credentials and log into the switch navigate to the ipv4 configuration and then ipv4 interface one more time now you can select and then click the delete icon to delete this ip address now you have one ip address for the switch click the red blinking save icon this can also be done under administration file management and file operations click duplicate running configuration to start a configuration and apply [Music] nice work you now know a few ways to change a dynamic ip address on vlan 1 to a static ip address on a cbs 220 250 or 350 switch thanks for watching i'll see you next

follow the steps we went through earlier [Music] another option is to add another ip address to the same vlan as a static ip it's important to note that if you're trying to add another ip address in the same subnet the switch will not allow it the solution is to add an ip address in a totally different subnet once that has been added you need to change your pc so it is in the same subnet that way they can connect and communicate to do this go into your windows settings under network and internet status settings enter change adapter options click the ethernet port you're using select properties then tcp ipv4 properties set a static ip in the same subnet that was assigned to vlan 1 on the switch the subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0 in this case i don't need to enter a default gateway but if

and can change over time in some cases you may want to change a dynamic ip to a static ip address so that it doesn't change this is considered a best practice on switches that handle a lot of network traffic if you need to set access rules firewall rules or make future changes on the switch you will want a static ip on the switch interface in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to convert a cisco business switch cbs 220 250 or 350 dynamic ip address to a static ip address on the vlan 1 interface to begin there are a few settings that need to be configured on the web user interface log into the switch by entering your username and password although the default for both is cisco in all lowercase it is best practice to change the default login credentials enter yours here next navigate to status and statistics and then system summary here you can see the mac address and firmware of the switch a mac address is the unique number associated with a specific piece of equipment the mac address can also be found on the back or the bottom of the switch knowing the mac address will help you find out the dhcp ip address that is connected to that switch [Music] move over to the ipv4 configuration tab and select ipv4 interface in this example the ip address type on the vlan 1 interface is dhcp and the current ip address ends in 1.129 the beginning two octets will be blurred in this video this is to maintain privacy for this network on this switch example the vlan 1 interface is the only one configured to change the ip address check the box in front of vlan 1 and then select the edit icon under ip address type select the static ip address radio button this has made the ip address static instead of dynamic if that's all you need you're set but if you want to change the static ip to a specific static ip address there are a few more steps that need to be performed to show this i'll close and not save the changes still on the ipv4 interface click the add icon leave vlan 1 choose static ip address and add an ip address in this case i'll enter an ip ending in 76.13 enter a prefix length of 24 which is the same as a network mask of 255.255.255.0 but

administrator is accessing the hardware accessing the web user interface is the easiest way to do configurations updates and troubleshooting it certainly comes in handy luckily every cisco business switch besides the 100 series comes with a web ui this type of interface what you see on your screen shows options for selection you do not need to know any special commands to navigate through these screens in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to access the web ui of your cisco business switch there are two different ways to access the web ui the first scenario is if the switch is not directly connected to your network and isn't receiving an ip address via your dhcp server the second scenario is when your switch is connected to your network and your network is providing a dhcp address for it i'll start with the switch not directly connected to the network to start we need to log into the switch with its ip address so we will need to determine what that ip address is i'm going to connect to the switch when it is not connected to the network getting a dhcp address to do this i'll connect the switch to my pc with an ethernet cable by default the switch will have an ip address of 192.168.1.254 [Music] in this situation on the front of the switch the system light will be flashing green that means it is up and operational but it is not receiving an ip address via dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp if the switch has an ip address assigned to it either via dhcp server or statically on the switch the system led will be solid green click the windows icon at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen select the gear icon for settings go into the networking internet options on the windows pc you can also access this with a right click on the internet status icon on the bottom right of your screen and select open network and internet settings change adapter options to go to the ethernet connection it shows an unidentified network right-click and select properties go into ipv4 double-click it or select and click properties statically assign an ip address to the computer in the same subnet as the switch in this case i'll enter 192.168.1.10 and hit tab the correct subnet mask automatically fills in with a slash 24 which is 255.255.255.0 [Music] we don't need a default gateway but if you want you can enter it it would be the ip address of the switch i'll skip that since it's all in the same subnet it isn't necessary click ok and then close nothing will change here on the status but if you want to verify your ip address on the computer open a command prompt here and enter ipconfig space all here under ethernet adapter the ip address is assigned as well as the subnet mask in the browser type in the ip address of the switch again it goes straight to the login screen the default username and password for both is cisco all lowercase once logged in you need to change the username and password assuming the password matches everything will go smoothly here and it should log you out of this switch when you hit apply and give it a couple of seconds from now on log in with the new credentials now that you are logged in you will notice a flashing red save icon which indicates that there has been a change to the configuration in this case it was the username and password from here you can manage the switch as needed now i'll show you how to manage the switch when it is connected directly to a network that is supplying a dhcp address to the switch first find out and verify that you have an ip address assigned to the computer in the same network as the switch in the windows search bar type cmd and select to open the command prompt enter ipconfig space forward slash all in this example my ethernet has the following ip address ending in dot 124 another way to find the ip address is to run an ip scanner there are many options for ip scanners that can be found and downloaded with a simple google search cisco does not support or recommend any specific software for this process the one i chose is called advanced ip scanner here you can see the ip address that is connected to a specific mac address a mac address is the unique number associated with a specific piece of equipment the mac address can also be found on the back or the bottom of the switch mine is the one ending in 2 5 colon 2 8 and it's receiving the ip address ending in 1 2 9. i'm going to put this ip address into a web browser in this example i'll use firefox once the ip address of the switch is entered the login screen is shown from here log in with your credentials to get into the web ui of the switch as you can see you're now logged into your device's web ui login page and have the power to control the switch as needed after following these steps for connectivity with your cbs switch you should be on your way thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp if the switch has an ip address assigned to it either via dhcp server or statically on the switch the system led will be solid green click the windows icon at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen select the gear icon for settings go into the networking internet options on the windows pc you can also access this with a right click on the internet status icon on the bottom right of your screen and select open network and internet settings change adapter options to go to the ethernet connection it shows an unidentified network right-click and select properties go into ipv4 double-click it or select and click properties statically assign an ip address to the computer in the same subnet as the switch in this case i'll enter 192.168.1.10 and hit tab the correct subnet mask automatically fills in with a slash 24 which is 255.255.255.0 [Music] we don't need a default gateway but if you want you can enter it it would be the ip address of the switch i'll skip that since it's all in the same subnet it isn't necessary click ok and then close nothing will change here on the status but if you want to verify your ip address on the computer open a command prompt here and enter ipconfig space all here under ethernet adapter the ip address is assigned as well as the subnet mask in the browser type in the ip address of the switch again it goes straight to the login screen the default username and password for both is cisco all lowercase once logged in you need to change the username and password assuming the password matches everything will go smoothly here and it should log you out of this switch when you hit apply and give it a couple of seconds from now on log in with the new credentials now that you are logged in you will notice a flashing red save icon which indicates that there has been a change to the configuration in this case it was the username and password from here you can manage the switch as needed now i'll show you how to manage the switch when it is connected directly to a network that is supplying a dhcp address to the switch first find out and verify that you have an ip address assigned to the computer in the same network as the switch in the windows search bar type cmd and select to open the command prompt enter ipconfig space forward slash all in this example my ethernet has the following ip address ending in dot 124 another way to find the ip address is to run an ip scanner there are many options for ip scanners that can be found and downloaded with a simple google search cisco does not support or recommend any specific software for this process the one i chose is called advanced ip scanner here you can see the ip address that is connected to a specific mac address a mac address is the unique number associated with a specific piece of equipment the mac address can also be found on the back or the bottom of the switch mine is the one ending in 2 5 colon 2 8 and it's receiving the ip address ending in 1 2 9. i'm going to put this ip address into a web browser in this example i'll use firefox once the ip address of the switch is entered the login screen is shown from here log in with your credentials to get into the web ui of the switch as you can see you're now logged into your device's web ui login page and have the power to control the switch as needed after following these steps for connectivity with your cbs switch you should be on your way thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

administrator is accessing the hardware accessing the web user interface is the easiest way to do configurations updates and troubleshooting it certainly comes in handy luckily every cisco business switch besides the 100 series comes with a web ui this type of interface what you see on your screen shows options for selection you do not need to know any special commands to navigate through these screens in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to access the web ui of your cisco business switch there are two different ways to access the web ui the first scenario is if the switch is not directly connected to your network and isn't receiving an ip address via your dhcp server the second scenario is when your switch is connected to your network and your network is providing a dhcp address for it i'll start with the switch not directly connected to the network to start we need to log into the switch with its ip address so we will need to determine what that ip address is i'm

right things and still have problems if you've installed any connect on your rv340 series router and are having connectivity problems don't spin out i'm here to help you get the pedal to the metal and get you connected in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you some troubleshooting steps for anyconnect vpn connectivity on rv340 series routers [Music] just like you would tune up a car to keep it up to date you should make sure that your rv340 series router has the latest firmware running you can verify this after signing into the router web user interface navigate to status and statistics and then system summary this screen shows you the firmware version that is active on the router to find out if it's the latest firmware version available for your device go to cisco.com click support and enter your rv340 series router model number and then downloads to check if you need to update the firmware on your device there are several articles and videos on the cisco website as well perform the upgrade save the updated configuration and reboot if your firmware is already the latest version make sure any running configurations are saved and then perform a reboot of the router a reboot can be a simple way to get things back on track to reboot the router navigate to administration and then reboot at this point you will select reboot the device option and then click reboot at the top of the screen when the router has finished rebooting try to connect to the vpn again if you're still unable to connect the next step is to make sure the rv340 series router has internet connectivity without connectivity your communication gets sent out but hits a dead end to check this go to administration and then diagnostic for this example i'll enter a known google server to ping on the internet by typing 8.8.8.8 in the ip address domain name field and then click ping as you can see the ping was successful which means the rv340 series router has internet access if your ping fails make sure your internet is properly connected to the wan port if it continues to fail then it could be due to an improper internet connection in a situation where your router is connected to a modem or another router try to reboot that device if an internet ping still fails this can be an internet service provider issue and you may need to speak to them to get it sorted out moving along the next troubleshooting step is to look at the router's logs basically looking under the hood of your network to generate logs you need to make sure that logging is enabled click on system configuration and then select log in the navigation pane click the box to enable select a debugging option for severity and then click apply it's important that this debugging option is only selected during troubleshooting as it consumes memory quickly at this point navigate to status and statistics and choose view logs in the menu click the all check box to unselect them then enable only the ssl vpn option and click on show logs make sure to click the clear logs button so that you will only see the fresh new logs [Music] have the client attempt to connect to the vpn if the client fails to connect click on show logs as you can see logs are being generated so this means that the vpn packets are getting to the router if there are no logs this means that no vpn packets are coming into the router now let's look at a scenario where logs are being generated when the client tries to connect in this example you can see some logs usually these logs will have relevant information as to why the vpn connection is failing in this log you can see that the password is not correct when you see this message make sure to check your accounts and verify that you are using the correct passwords to do this go ahead and click on system configuration and then user accounts on this screen you can see the accounts that are available for this example i created the user1 account for anyconnectvpn use now i'll click edit to look at it in your case if you want to enter a new password simply enter the old password and fill out the new password fields if you've forgotten the password then the best option is to create a new user with a new password it's like getting a new key made for your car to create a new user go to local users and click the plus sign to add then enter your username and password make sure to add the correct group that is being used to authenticate to the ssl vpn for this example the group is anyconnect but keep in mind that your group may be different go ahead and click apply to save your changes another troubleshooting method is to make sure that the vpn authentication is configured correctly to check this scroll down to service auth sequence as you can see the anyconnect ssl vpn auth sequence is set to default if you are authenticating vpn users using a radius server then this configuration is fine if your vpn users are being authenticated locally from the rv340 series router then you'll need to set the primary to localdb or local database it's also important to choose a secondary auth and you can set this to be any one of the options except none click apply to save the configuration and then confirm the changes were saved if the router didn't save the configuration perform these last steps again and click apply [Music] to check this when the user attempts to connect to the vpn again click on show logs to confirm that the vpn tunnel has been established correctly now consider a scenario where you are not getting any vpn logs what do you do then first look at the ssl vpn configuration on the router just like construction can shut down roads closed ports can stop connections to check this navigate to vpn and then open ssl vpn and check the gateway port this port needs to be open to connect the vpn most of the time if the router is directly connected to the internet service provider the router will automatically open this port and you won't need to change anything but sometimes the router connects to the internet through an isp modem or a different router if this is the case you'll need to make sure the router or modem in front of the rv 340 series router is port forwarding the gateway port to the rv 340 router i feel confident that these troubleshooting steps will get you out of the starting gate and into the fast lane however if your vpn is still not connecting contact a cisco representative for more advanced troubleshooting please see the link attached to the description for more information thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

inside the privilege exec mode once inside type configure terminal to get into the global configuration mode of the switch now to enable stp enter spanning tree followed by the command mode to select which stp protocol to run as you can see there are five different mode options available stp rstp which is the default mode mst pvst and rapid pvst for this example i'll use stp next the spanning tree bridge forward time this is the amount of time a port remains in the listening and learning states before entering the forwarding state the range is 4 to 30 seconds and the default value is 15 seconds for this example i'm going to enter spanning tree forward times 16. when configuring the forward time the following relationship should be maintained two into forward time minus one should be greater than or equal to max age moving along the spanning tree max age command can be used to configure stp maximum age this determines how often broadcast hello messages are sent out the range is 6 to 40 and the default maximum age is 20 seconds here 16 specifies the spanning tree bridge maximum age in seconds when configuring the maximum age keep in mind two into forward time minus one should be greater than or equal to max age the max age is greater than or equal to two into hello time plus one now the roof bridge can be configured the range is zero to sixty one thousand four hundred forty and the default bridge priority is thirty two thousand seven hundred sixty eight in this example i'll type spanning tree priority 12 288 where 12 288 specifies the bridge priority the priority value must be a multiple of 4096. the switch with the lowest priority is the route of the spanning tree when more than one switch has the lowest priority the switch with the lowest mac address is selected as the route set the default path cost method just type the spanning tree pathcost method command [Music] looking at the options there are two cost methods long and short for this example i'm going to select long which is also the default setting okay that completed successfully so you should be set on the basics from here you have some options for additional stp commands these commands would be set and executed on specific ports by default spanning tree is enabled on all ports so to disable spanning tree on a specific port enter interface fi101 where one slash zero slash one indicates the specific port number followed by the command spanning tree disabled that's it the interface is disabled to move on simply type exit to move to another interface [Music] to configure the spanning tree path cost for a port log into the interface the range is 1 to two hundred million for this example i'll type spanning tree cost thirty five thousand thirty five thousand specifies the port path cost it's important to note that the default path cost is determined by the port speed and path cost method in this interface you need to configure port priority the range is 0 to 240 and the default port priority is 128. for this one use 96 by entering spanning tree port priority 96 sometimes you may want to enable port fast mode for an interface so that it is put into a forwarding state upon linkup without waiting for the standard forward time delay to do this enter interface fi104 then type the spanning tree portfast command alternatively you can use the spanning tree portfast auto command to delay the portfast mode for three seconds typing spanning tree bpdu defines bridge protocol data unit or bpdu handling when the spanning tree is disabled globally or on a single interface as you can see there are two modes flooding and filtering on this interface i'll use flooding which is the default setting the filtering and flooding modes are relevant when the spanning tree is disabled globally or on a single interface to define bpdu handling when the spanning tree is disabled on a single interface go ahead and enter the interface followed by spanning tree bpdu flooding if you want to shut down all interfaces if a loopback bpdu is received on them simply type spanning tree loopback guard bravo now you have a pack of commands you can use to configure stp on your cbs switch using the cli it can make all the difference in an efficient network because unlike an energetic puppy you don't want your network to tire out thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music]",

exploration moving in the right direction in your part of the world you want your employees to have secure access to company resources from anywhere they go to that's where a virtual private network a vpn comes in with a client-to-site vpn employees can connect to the server and access the corporate network or local area network behind the server all while maintaining the privacy and security of the network and its resources if you have employees that use a mac computer you have an rv340 series router and you want to set up an anyconnect vpn houston that is not a problem in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to configure an rv340 series router to use anyconnect vpn with mac ios clients [Music] first things first if you haven't purchased the anyconnect license or downloaded the anyconnect client software yet you will need to do this before following this process to start configurations click on vpn ssl vpn and then on for the cisco ssl vpn server the gateway will be the interface with internet access in this case wan1 the default gateway port is 8443 i will leave that as the default okay next you'll need to enter a client address pool keep in mind that these addresses need to be different from both the router's network and the clients network the network mask is entered and the rest of the settings will remain as default for group policies click on the default policy and then edit here a secondary dns can be added but since i'm using my router as the dns i won't add another one fill in the rest of the fields in this example i'll keep wins as default skip adding a description leave ie proxy settings disabled and enable split tunnel [Music] before moving on a little more detail on the split tunnel some people configure it to keep the client's internet traffic at higher speeds with split tunnel you can define which networks you want to access over the vpn essentially you can grant access through the vpn to certain networks and deny access to other networks on the router split tunnel will also only send the client's traffic through the vpn if it's destined for the defined networks all other traffic will be sent out of the client's default gateway since i want to grant access to my router's network i will enter that network under ip address and then the network mask if there are more networks that you wanted to grant the client access to another ip address would be added since there isn't any in my case i just need to click apply ok now that part is set next a user group needs to be created this group will house the user accounts that will have access to the vpn here click add give the group a name and scroll down to ssl vpn under select a profile select the ssl vpn default policy then click apply now you can see the new group has the ssl vpn policy enabled and the admin group has access to the ssl vpn disable access to the ssl vpn for the admin group that group won't have access to the vpn scroll down to ssl vpn and under select a profile choose no policy all right now the only group that has access to the vpn is the anyconnect group next move over to user accounts here is where the user accounts and passwords that connect to the vpn will be created to do this click add enter a username the password and choose the group that was just configured new usernames and passwords will need to be created for all users that will access the vpn click on apply and then click the save icon to save the running configuration to the startup configuration great anyconnect is now configured on your rv340 series router moving right along it's time for the second section of the configurations setting up the mac vpn client if you do not have a license yet please call a cisco authorized partner to purchase one if you do not have a cisco partner see the link in the description once you have the anyconnect license purchased you can download the cisco anyconnect client from cisco agree to the software license agreement and confirm the install [Music] you may get a message like what is shown here saying the extension was blocked if so you will need to edit your system preferences click allow once and then again for the installation to be complete okay to get everything connected open the anyconnect client and enter the router's public address followed by the port number you chose in the rv 340 series router configuration i left the port at the default of 8443 you can check the port number you configured in the rv 340 series under ssl vpn and gateway port click connect you may see an untrusted server message because anyconnect doesn't recognize the rv340 series public ip address don't worry the settings can be changed i know that this ip address is my router's public ip address so there's no security issue therefore i will change my setting and uncheck the block connections option and click connect again another message may appear like in this instance but since this public ip address is set to my rv 340 series router i know it is a trusted server and i can click connect anyway the username and password you created on the router needs to be entered once clicking on accept the vpn is connected mission accomplished now that the configurations are complete if you want to see how many users are connected to the vpn navigate to system summary click status and statistics and scroll down under vpn status to ssl vpn here it will show how many connected sessions are running one giant leap for mankind oh yeah now your mac users can use anyconnect vpn to access the network in a simple secure way no rocket scientist required thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

        "transcript": "have you ever gone to visit a friend and want to use their wi-fi when you search for available wi-fi networks in your current location you'll see a list of service set identifiers ssids to choose from often when people have wi-fi set up they just leave the ssid to whatever the internet service provider has as its default for that connection typically these ssids are generic listing the provider and then a combination of letters and numbers as shown here there's nothing wrong with keeping the ssid at the default name it works just fine but what if you owned a business like a car repair shop you'd want customers to enjoy their time while they wait you'd offer coffee snacks and wi-fi anything to make their time go by faster a personalized ssid can make it easy for the customer to find your network and get logged in in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll demonstrate how to configure a wireless local area network wlan service set identifier ssid on a cisco business wireless access point to get started log in to your cisco business wireless access point by entering the username and password click sign in after accessing the web user interface of your device navigate to the wireless settings and select wlans here you can view the existing wlan configurations to create a new ssid click on the add new wlan rlan button as you can see under the general tab the wlan id field will auto populate in this case it shows wlan number three as the first option since two wlans are already configured in my network you need to make sure to configure type as wlan to allow devices to connect and communicate in wireless mode next type a profile name in the field provided in this example new underscore ssid is entered you'll want to choose something easy for customers to identify this could be the name of your business or something else creative just keep in mind that the profile name must be unique and not exceed 31 characters the profile name also acts as the ssid but you can choose an ssid that is different from the wlan profile name and to keep things simple i'll use the same name for both profile name and ssid fields after that to enable wlan simply slide the toggle button next select a radio policy from the drop down menu the options include all 5 gigahertz and 2.4 gigahertz for this example all is selected so that the ssid will be visible for both the radio 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz the broadcast ssid feature is enabled by default so the ssid can be discovered by wireless clients wanting to join it the next field is local profiling this is disabled by default if you enable this option you can either view the operating system that is running on the client or the username in this case i'll leave it as disabled next navigate to the wlan security tab here if you enable the guest network the wlan will be considered a guest wlan that provides guest user access this may be what you want but for this example it is left as disabled the captive network assistant feature detects the presence of a captive portal by sending a web request for connecting to a wireless network typically this request is directed to a url for iphone models if a response is received then the internet access is considered available and no further interaction is required if no response is received internet access is assumed to be blocked by the captive portal if this is the case apple's captive portal network assistant auto launches the sudo browser to request a portal login in a controlled window i'm going to leave captive network assistant disabled okay that's the basics so if that's all you need save the configurations and you're set time to get back to business if you want to configure more advanced parameters keep watching i'll start with mac filtering you can restrict or permit a particular client joining your network by enabling the mac filtering feature when mac filtering is enabled on the wlan the client mac address must be added to the local mac address list in this case this feature is disabled under security type select wpa2 wpa3 personnel here wpa2 is enabled by default you can also enable wpa3 individually if the client is wpa3 compatible i'll enable wpa3 next to configure passphrase format i'll choose an ascii value the wpa pre-shared key must contain 8 to 63 ascii text characters or 64 hexadecimal characters after entering the passphrase go ahead and enter it again in the confirm passphrase field you can click on the show passphrase checkbox to see the passphrase you have configured the password expiry feature is disabled by default to enable simply slide the toggle button the maximum range for expiry is 180 days in this scenario it's not enabled from here navigate to the vlan and firewall tab select client ip management as the external dhcp server that will allow the external dhcp server in your network to provide ip addresses to the client [Music] on the next line the peer-to-peer block option is disabled by default if you enable this it'll disable communication between clients that are connected in the same wlan in this case i'm going to go with the default settings after that for the use vlan tagging and enable firewall fields i'll select no the default setting however if you want to tag a vlan in your network for the specific wlan you can enable the vlan tagging option and specify the vlan id from the drop-down menu if you enable the firewall you'll need to configure additional parameters including vlan acl and wlan post auth acl these will be applicable for all wlans under the same vlan next navigate to the traffic shaping tab and select silver best effort option for quality of service qos finally navigate to the scheduling tab here you can choose the schedule for the wlan profile that you're creating you have the option to enable the schedule and apply to all weekdays after that you can specify the time the new ssid will be active for this example 8 o'clock am to 8 o'clock pm is selected once you finalize your settings you can click the apply button the configurations will take effect and the new ssid or new wlan will be created now you know how to add a new wlan and configure an ssid on your cisco business wireless access point customers love when things are easy and simple and when you create a positive experience they'll be back thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

        "transcript": "are you looking to set up anyconnect on a router you're not alone anyconnect vpn is used in many different types of cisco networks most often it's configured on cisco enterprise routers there's one group of routers that was created for small to medium-sized businesses that can also use any connect for their vpn i'm talking about the rv340 series that includes the rv340 rv 345 and rv345p models this video is meant to assist with configuration of these specific routers if you're using other cisco routers this is not the video for you still with me okay then you must be in the right place let's get started in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll demonstrate how to configure an rv340 series router to use anyconnect vpn [Music] first things first if you haven't purchased an anyconnect client license or downloaded the anyconnect client software yet you'll need to do this before configuring your clients on their side contact your cisco partner or purchase a pack of licenses online all set access your router select vpn and then ssl vpn here go ahead and turn the cisco ssl vpn server to on the gateway will be the interface that has internet access in this example that's wan one i'll leave the gateway port as 8443 which is the default when configuring a client address pool keep in mind that this address needs to be different from the routers and clients network i'll enter the network mask and keep the rest of the settings as default to move the configuration along navigate to the group policies tab at the top select the ssl vpn default policy and then click edit here you can add a secondary dns i'm using my router as the primary dns so i'll leave that blank next i'll leave the ie proxy settings as disabled and enable the split tunnel it's important to note that the split tunnel can be useful to keep the client's internet traffic at higher speeds as well as help define which networks you want to access over the vpn also enabling this feature will only send the client's traffic through the vpn if it is destined for the defined networks all other traffic will be sent out of the client's default gateway now to grant access to your router's network click the plus icon and enter the network ip address followed by the network mask if you would need to add more networks for the clients to access you could simply enter another ip address range now that all the networks have been added click apply the next step is to create a user group housing all the user accounts that will have access to the vpn to do this navigate to system configuration and then user groups here click on add and give the group a name once that's done scroll down to ssl vpn and choose the ssl vpn default policy from the select a profile drop down menu and click apply now you should see the new group has the ssl vpn default policy enabled for it if you want to disable access to the ssl vpn for a group simply select the group in this example i'm going to select the admin group click edit and scroll down to the ssl vpn under select a profile choose no policy perfect now only the anyconnect group has access to the ssl vpn next to create the user accounts and passwords that will connect to the vpn navigate to user accounts under system configuration and click on add enter a username and password and select the group you just created you'll need to create new usernames and passwords for all users who are accessing the vpn by clicking apply you're set there just be sure to save the running configuration to startup configuration by clicking the red blinking save icon now that any connect has been configured on the router log in by entering the router's public ip address and the port number in the client window click connect after that enter the username and password that was configured in the router's user account click ok and then accept a warning may appear informing you that the router does not have a trusted certificate but since the router is a trusted device go ahead and ignore this warning by clicking on connect anyway great now you have the vpn configured on the router side the next steps are to set up the client side of the anyconnect vpn see link in the description for details on this process once the client side has been configured you can see how many clients are connected to the vpn by navigating to status and statistics then under system summary scroll down to the vpn status section the ssl vpn will show the number of connected sessions thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "today many businesses use a vpn a virtual private network if you need a vpn on your rv160 or 260 router and are hoping to keep things simple let's go in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll show you how to configure the rv160 or rv260 router to use openvpn with a password only for client authentication [Music] configuring an rv160 or rv 260 router to use openvpn with a password only for authentication is a simpler and faster method as opposed to using a certificate and password authentication what makes it less complicated there's no need to create a client certificate while utilizing password-only authentication to set up the router clients will authenticate using passwords however a certificate authority ca certificate and a router certificate are required for both methods before configuring the router a ca and a router certificate need to be generated to generate the first certificate click on administration certificate generate csr ca certificate as type and then a name choose fqdn for the subject alternative name this name can be ambiguous but the name must have a dot in it just finishing up the rest of the fields it's important to note that the common name must be the same as the subject alternative name following this choose a valid duration period and click generate to generate the certificate since a second certificate is needed the next step is to again select generate csr certificate and then certificate signed by a ca certificate as type from the drop-down list you need to enter a name for the certificate select fqdn as the subject's alternative name and give it a name following that the rest of the boxes need to get filled in don't forget the common name must match the subject alternative name for the certificate authority so choose the certificate that you already created earlier and enter a valid duration period moving along it's time to configure openvpn on the router select system configuration create a group give it a name click the on button for openvpn under services after making changes to the configurations it's important to click apply to save these new settings [Music] next click add under local users enter a username and then a password to create a new account this will be the client's password for the openvpn choose the group from the drop-down list that you created earlier if more clients need to be added to the vpn a username and password will need to be generated for them as well it's best practice to store the username and password type them in and then click apply navigating to user groups the group that was created is displayed when moving over to the user groups the newly created group has openvpn enabled next configure the openvpn settings by clicking vpn openvpn clicking enable and then selecting when as the interface remember the ca certificate authority that was created earlier it's time to use that confirm that the server certificate is the second certificate that was previously created next choose password only for the client authentication after that choose split tunnel which allows you to specify which networks you want to connect to via vpn split tunnels can be beneficial as they provide vpn access to certain networks on the router while denying access to the others split tunnels will also send the clients traffic through the vpn if it is destined for the defined networks all other traffic will be sent out to the client's default gateway now input the network address under ip address followed by the network mask to grant access to your router's network if there were more networks that were cleared for client access you could enter another ip address in addition a secondary dns could be added so for a backup insert the known google dns server and click apply next export the ovpn file by selecting export client configuration template click on generate confirm and then click the red blinking icon to save under configuration management save the running configuration to the startup configuration click that handy apply a button once again sometimes the rv router will be double netted behind a modem or a router if you are double netted there are a couple more steps to follow this can be checked by navigating to system summary then when and checking for an ip address if the ip address is private the router is double netted plan time for just a few added steps in your configuration if the ip address is public you can skip ahead if it is double matted find and open your ovpn file modify the ip address under remote and provide your public ip address because it is double netted you need to make sure that port forwarding is configured for port 1194 to the cisco rv router once this is confirmed save the changes to the file okay next configure the openvpn client to import the ovpn file that was exported from the rv router the router's public ip address should appear under the server hostname following this enter the username and password that was set up on the rb router once connect is clicked a pop-up message occurs click continue to connect the ovpn client that should do it openvpn is configured and connected to your rv160 or rv260 router with password-only authentication thanks for watching see you next time [Music] you",

[Music] these are connected via the lan to the authentication server or the radius server which is configured on a windows 2019 server its ip address is 172. now that i've shown you the overview of how everything works together i'll look at some of the settings the windows 2019 server has already been configured as an active directory domain controller the radius or npas server feature has been enabled on the local server menu here i can see that the ethernet ip is 172.16.1. and the operating system is microsoft windows server 2019 on the npas menu i'll look at the server and confirm the ip address is 172.16.1.4 now i'll open the network policy server settings i'll click on radius clients and servers on the left panel and under that i'll select radius clients to see what switches are enabled for this network on the settings tab i see the cbs 350 switch has been added as a radius client then on the advanced tab i see the name of the vendor which in this case is cisco now i'll close this window and then go to the left panel and click on the connection request policies option under the policies menu if i double-click secure wired ethernet connections it opens a new window and in the overview tab i can see that policy state has been enabled [Music] under the conditions tab i see that the condition is set to nas port type the settings tab displays all the default settings now back in the network policies menu i see that the policy named secure wired ethernet connections is enabled for this server when i double click on it i can see the settings for this policy under the overview tab i can see that the policy state has been enabled i can also see that access permission has been set to grant access under the conditions tab i see that the nasport type condition shows ethernet as the media type [Music] under the constraints tab i see that microsoft encrypted authentication version 2 has also been selected eap types are shown here on this window now i'll click on the settings tab and see that under attributes frame protocol is ppp and service type is framed i'll exit this window and open the local server settings again but this time i'll click on the tasks drop down on the right side of the screen i'll click on the active directory users and computers and then click managed service accounts this screen shows the active directory users and computers and i see that cisco lab is listed here as user when i double click on cisco lab it opens another window showing me all the properties for this user here i see the first and last name are cisco lab and the display name is a combination of the two now i'll click on the account tab to see the user logon name when i select the dial-in tab it shows me that the network access permission has been set to allow access under the remote control tab i can see that enable remote control has been selected and so it's enabled as well now i'll click on the tab called member of and check that it's a member of the domain users that was shown in the account tab after looking and checking all the settings in the server manager i'll log into my switch to configure the required settings first i'll log in with my username and password now that i've logged in the first thing i need to do is change the mode from basic to advanced in the top right corner of the screen this is how i get the options that i need to configure the switch i need to click on system summary under status and statistics in the left panel and confirm that my firmware version is up to date in this case it's 3.1.1.7 now i'll open the security menu and select the radius client option on this page i'm going to set the radius accounting to port based access control 802.1x mac based web authentication and i'll keep the rest of the configuration with the default settings now at the bottom of the page in the radius table i'm going to click on the plus icon to add a new radius server i'll add the details on the add radius server page i'll keep the buttons that are already selected here to add the server definition by ip address and the ip version will stay as version 4. [Music] next in the server ip address name field i'll enter the ip address that we saw earlier it will be 172.16.1.4 and then i'll enter one as the priority next i'll change the key string setting to user define plain text and then enter the key string into the field i won't change any other settings on this page now i'll click apply to save this configuration and i should see the notification at the top of the screen that it was successful when i click the close button i can see the server i just configured is now added to the radius table back on the radius client page now i'll open the 802.1x authentication option from the left panel next i'll select the properties page first thing i need to do is enable the port-based authentication all the other settings here will stay the same so again i'll click the apply button i should see the success notification at the top of this screen when it's done and successful now i'll select the port authentication page where i'm going to select the port number where the windows 10 client is going to connect on this page i'll select the switch port 2 under the port authentication table and then click the edit button at the top on this page i'll change the setting for administrative port control to auto then i need to check and make sure that 802.1x based authentication is also checked and enabled i'll keep the other parameters here set to the default and then click the apply button once again i can close this window when i see the notification at the top of the window that this was successful back in this window i can see that the port authentication table now shows that administrative port control is now set to auto for switch port number two next i'll open the vlan management page and then select the port vlan membership page where i can see the vlan mapping on that port that i just configured i see that ge2 interface is set to access mode and vlan 1 is allowed on that switch port now the final step is to configure the windows 10 client to do that i need to open the run option on that system using the start menu or by pressing the windows and r button together on the keyboard i'll enter services.msc in this field and then click ok in the services window i'll scroll down the page and double click on wired auto config this opens the window where i can check and make sure all the settings are what i want everything looks good startup type is selected as automatic so now i'll click ok to exit this window now i need to configure the network interface card back in the run command window i'll enter mcpa.cpl and click ok this opens the network properties window where i can double-click on the ethernet interface to open a new window under the authentication tab i'll make sure that enable ieee 802.1x authentication is checked i'll also click on the settings button here to make sure that enable fast reconnect is also checked but first i need to make sure that the network authentication method is secured password eap-ms-chappy2 also i need to make sure that the check box next to verify the server's identity by validating the certificate is not checked i'll click ok now i'll click the additional settings button now to open the advanced settings tab for the 802.1x i need to make sure that specify authentication mode is enabled in the drop down menu under specify authentication mode i need to make sure that user authentication is selected then i'll disable the checkbox for enable single sign-on for this network now i'll click ok and then ok again to close these screens my windows 10 system will get connected to the ge2 port where it will then get the username and password authentication prompt with the username and admin password my system will be authenticated [Music] to save this configuration i just need to click the save icon at the top of the page this is how i configured my windows server 2019 radius settings with a cbs 350 switch and 802.1x client if this configuration is right for you it's your turn thanks for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you",

        "transcript": "cisco business dashboard the network management tool simplifies the job of managing a network it automates deployment monitoring and lifecycle management of your network in this episode of cisco tech talks i'm going to show you how easy it is to configure a switch port through cisco business dashboard first i'll log into the cisco business dashboard with my username and password and then click the log in button once i'm logged in i need to check the version so i'll click on the little icon on the right hand side of the screen and in this case the version is 2.3.0 next i'll open the menu option on the left side of the screen and click on port management when i open the port management page i can see all the switch ports that are deployed in my network the model number and serial number of each switch port is displayed above it to start the process of configuring a switch port i'm going to click on it like this when i've selected it i can see the configuration details in the panel on the right side of the screen in this case the gi-1 port is selected on the cbs 250 8fp e2g switch now let's scroll down the screen to see what we can configure for this switch port here in the general tab i can see the mac address duplex and other settings for this switch port and this is where i can enable or disable this port i can simply click on the edit button and then select the check box next to enabled or disabled for right now i'll leave this checked as enabled when i'm done if i made any changes i must save them so i'll click on the floppy disk icon which i'll call the save icon from here on i can also configure the speed and duplex setting for this switch port here now click on the edit button in the ethernet tab and then i can select the speed from the drop down menu the options here are 10 100 1000 or auto for now i'll keep it set to auto i can also select an option from the duplex drop down menu the options are half full and auto again i won't make any changes and we'll keep this set as auto but i'm still going to click on the save icon i should see a notification on the top of the screen that says ethernet configuration was saved successfully and a job created to apply it to the device this is a good reminder that i was successful at making any updates if i need to this is where i can select and add a new vlan for this port the first thing i'll practice here is how to select a vlan to start with i'll scroll down to the vlan tab and then click on the select vlan option next to vlan setting the window that opens next has a list of all the trunk vlans in this port i'll select the vlan that i want and then click the arrow in the center to move it to the right hand column and then i need to click the save button this will create the job and at the top of the screen again i'll see a notification that the vlan configuration was saved successfully and a job created to apply it to the device at this point i can look at the trunk vlan field and see the vlan that i just edited i can also create a new vlan to do this i'll click on the create vlan option and then enter a vlan id and vlan name in the pop-up window so enter 20 in the vlan id field then enter vlan 20 in the vlan name field [Music] note that there are two check boxes in the window and that i need to pick one they are create on all devices in the same group and create on all devices in the organization you can select either one but for this example i'm going to click on the check box create on all devices in the same group and then click the save button this job will be created and again at the top of the screen i can see the notification that the vlan 20 creation job successfully created when i'm all done i can now see the id of the vlan i just created in the trunk vlan field next to the vlan i selected earlier i can configure the power over ethernet settings here to do that i'll first click on the edit icon in the poe tab to see what the poa priority options are for this port when i click on the drop down menu i'll see what options are there if i choose critical this priority class always receives power what this means is if there is not enough power to use on all the ports then the ports assigned in this class are prioritized if i select high it receives power only if all critical priority ports are receiving power if i select low this port receives power only if all critical priority and high priority ports are receiving power right now there isn't a poe schedule configured for this port but if any had been this is where i would select it from the drop down menu here [Music] now here is where i can select the toggle power for the port all i need to do is click the toggle power button and once again i can see the notification on the top of the screen that says toggle the poe power successfully now that i'm finished with the poe settings i'll click on the floppy disk icon again to save the configuration now in this panel i can configure my green ethernet settings to start i need to click the edit icon now i can see that eee enable is already checked when this option is turned on there will be less power consumption during periods of low data activity in the network the other option i see here is short reach i can enable this by clicking the check box and then i can run the links with less power than i normally use one thing to remember here is that i can't enable short reach and eee enable at the same time if i need to turn on short reach then i must turn off the eee enable option for this episode i'll keep the ee enable option checked and finally this is where i can configure settings for smart ports the smart port settings panel is where i determine what devices can connect to this particular switchboard right now i can see that auto smart port is selected for this gi 1 switch port based on the devices that are currently connected to this switchboard it looks like i can select other smart port settings like a printer desktop or server in this case i'll select server again i'll see the notification at the top of the screen that the smart port config was saved successfully and a job created to apply it to the device which means the server has been selected now you've seen how simple it is to configure switch ports from the port management window using cisco business

watson just call me sherlock and grab your magnifying glass my wireless network is having problems and needs help come along for the ride it'll be excellent in this episode of cisco tech talk i'll explore several troubleshooting options to get my wireless network back on track and you will too i'll start with verifying some physical and environmental conditions first i'll check is all the equipment turned on that includes the access point mesh extender and any other device which is present in the cisco business wireless is the link light glowing consistently if it's green that's a good sign are the cables connected correctly check the cable connectivity am i facing a local area network connectivity issue i'll need to check if the cable is properly connected could it be a bad cable am i facing a speed and duplex negotiation issue you should check the cable that may be the issue is the equipment overheating if the access point or mesh extender is not performing properly it can be caused by the overheating of the device make sure your devices are kept in a controlled temperature and work fine could it be an environmental factor such as where it's located are the devices located near any other wireless or other devices which may be causing interference within the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz network we need to consider those factors as well are there any metal or thick walls between the access point and the wireless device this can disrupt the wireless signal by weakening the signal if the client is completely unable to connect maybe it's due to the client being out of range if the wireless client is out of the ap's coverage area it won't connect since the client may be trying to connect to a specific ap next i'll log into cisco business wireless access point and see what other troubleshooting we can perform click login to log into the cisco business wireless access point enter the username and password click sign in to log into the cisco business wireless network once i log into the cisco business wireless primary ap under network summary in the main menu i can see the lan indicators for the default gateway ip or management interface here i can check the intranet indicator to see if the public dns 8.8.8.8 is within range the wireless indicators check the wireless connectivity by looping through all access points within the networks both the networks a and b are enabled if a network is down in any of the aps the wireless status is considered to be down otherwise the wireless indicator is operational i'll click clients available under the monitoring menu to troubleshoot the connection issue with the wireless client i can check the logging level for notifications and the logs in the primary ap under management and logging section [Music] next in the monitoring menu i'll click clients to check the details once the client is visible i can see the different parameters for that client such as signal strength connection speed client types mac address connected wlans and the duration of the connection i can click on this client to troubleshoot any connectivity issues if i scroll down this client view page then i'll be able to see the ping test option click start to check the latency and reachability between the primary ap and the client this displays the latency you can see that the client is reachable with a 5 out of 5 attempt success rate in the connection tab i can perform a connection test i may choose to perform a connection test when the client fails to connect to a particular wlan this test takes about three minutes i'll attempt to connect during the three minute test while it generates diagnostic information to help in the troubleshooting i'll click start to enable the client debugging i'll click ok and wait for three minutes then i'll click stop to get the client test diagnostics now the event log testing contains the time stamp and message details that are exchanged between the client and the access point the message type helps to analyze and conclude if a client is able to successfully join a wlan i'll click on start to start the process and then i can stop it and save the report to a local system i'll click ok to save the report to a local system now i'll click on access points available under monitoring to see the troubleshooting options available i can select any of the access points in this case i'll select this mesh extender and see what the troubleshooting options are i can see the access point parameters [Music] i'll scroll down the page to check if the tech support option is available i can start the process to get the tech support bundle i'll click ok and the tech support status is showing in progress once the status is completed i'll click on download to get the tech support file i can save that file this is a compressed file so i'll need to extract that file to see the details i'll click ok to save the file using any zip application i can open the compressed file to check the details within this troubleshooting file on this access point page i can see the client's options if any client is associated with that access point then it will be displayed here under this mesh extender it's not showing but i can see that under any other access point it will be visible so i can see that on this ap one client is associated here the rf troubleshooting option displays a visual graphical representation of the parameters that can affect the access point's radio performance spectrum intelligence by default is visible in order to reduce the cpu cycles and increase the performance of the cisco business wireless i can enable spectrum intelligence from the advanced rf optimizing parameter under tools i can enable or disable ap led blink led import or export the config or transfer the firmware or image the restart ap and factory default options are not available on the primary ap i can verify that by going to the access point where i can see that this is a master primary ap so i'll click on that [Music] and under tools i can see that the restart and reboot options are reset and the reboot option is not available i can reboot or reset the access point using those two options next i'll navigate to the advanced menu to see rf optimization menu and check the rf optimization parameters i'll move that slide bar to the right to enable the rf optimization to maximize the wi-fi network performance i can optimize the rf signals coverage in quality now i can see that the rf automation client density is showing as low [Music] by default the medium client density based rf setting is applied now we can see the traffic type applicable here from the drop down i can see traffic type either data or voice and data so i'll keep this as data using the expert view i can see more parameters and i can click on switch to expert view and navigate to the expert view [Music] here i can see the various parameters which influence the cisco business wireless network performance such as the 2.4 gigahertz optimized roaming and 5 gigahertz optimized roaming to enable the 2.4 gigahertz optimized roaming and 5 gigahertz optimized roaming i need to move the slide bar to the right optimize roaming resolves the problems of the sticky clients associated with access points that are located far away and outbound clients that attempt to connect to a wi-fi network without a stable connection roaming allows the client to disassociate based on the rssi of the client data packets and data rate optimized roaming also prevents a client association when the client's rssi is low by checking the incoming client's rssi against the rssi threshold thus if any wireless client is facing a connectivity issue i can check the spam filters on the cisco business wireless i can see the and 5 gigahertz intervals the interval range is between 5 to 90 seconds 90 is the default value if i configure a low reporting interval the network can be overloaded with coverage report messages if the interval is set to a value other than the 90 seconds then the client statistics will be sent only during the failure cases i can see that 2.4 gigahertz threshold and 5 gigahertz threshold options are currently set as disable however i can set the default parameter from the drop down for 2.4 and 5 gigahertz [Music] the client will get disassociated if the current data rate of the client is lower than the optimized roaming data rate threshold so i'll keep that as disable for now so if any of the threshold is defined the client is not able to reach it i can see the event driven rrm radio resource management which is currently enabled this toggle allows an ap in distress to bypass normal radio resource management intervals and immediately change the channel this is a global setting and can be enabled or disabled for this event driven rrm i can move the slide bar to enable now the interfere detection is currently disabled i can move the slide bar to enable that this is a global setting which enables the primary ap to detect the non-wi-fi sources by default it's disabled so i'll keep it as disabled the 5 gigahertz channel width is currently set as 20 megahertz i can select the different channel bandwidth from the drop down menu the channel bandwidth option controls how broad the signal is for transferring data such as 20 megahertz 40 megahertz 80 megahertz or best by increasing the channel bandwidth i can increase the speed and throughput of a wireless broadcast this global setting is set to best by default so i'll keep that then i can see that 2.4 and 5 gigahertz data rates option are currently set at a lower density for both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz networks if i increase that then the legacy devices will not be able to connect if i move it to 12 ups then 802.11 b devices are not supported same is for five gigahertz network if i enable or enhance that value then some legacy devices are not supported so i need to check this parameter if a legacy device or legacy client is not able to associate it to our wireless network that whether these parameters are enabled on 2.4 or 5 gigahertz networks or not then the final parameter on these pages selects dca channels this is the child dynamic channel assignment i can select or click individual channels to be included in dca for 2.4 and 5 gigahertz band a green underline below the channel number indicates that it's selected i can click on that to unselect it once i finalize the configuration then i can click apply to save the settings it will show a notification on the screen and i'll click yes to continue [Music] on the primary ap tools page available under the advanced menu i can see the primary ap troubleshooting tools by clicking on restrict primary ap i can restart the primary ap if i'm still facing any issues then i need to reboot i can perform it from here or the configuration management tab [Music] i can either download or upload the configuration via http sftp or ftp or tftp method and i can see the restore to factory default settings if i need to bring our access point to the default settings i can click reset to factory default settings and bring that to the default configuration under the troubleshooting file tab i can download the tech support i did that initially from the access point menu so from here also i can download the tech support bundle and by the ftp method and http method i can select the transfer mode and click on apply settings under the troubleshooting tools i can see the various options available like ssh v2 access by default this ssh is visible for all aps connected to the cisco business wireless network ssh can be enabled by the cisco technical support team for debugging process now the dns servers is showing the cisco umbrella and probably dns like 8.8.8.8 i can choose that dns server from the dropdown i can choose either umbrella or i can specify any new dns server i need to enter the dns server follow-up if i want to use a specific dns server for our network or device i then can apply that here then i can use the ping test tool to check the reachability of a client or any domain here i can ping any ip this is a public dns ip that i can ping i can click start and i can see the ping test result here i can also check the dns status i can click start to verify that cisco.com is a valid one dns and its radius response tools operate like a simulation tool to verify if the primary ap can reach the radius server it also verifies the username and password that are present in radius server next i'll enter the user details and password and click start to verify to clear the parameters click clear so that will clear the test parameters to default elementary my dear watson i have solved the case and my wireless network is as good as new it's time for this gum shoe to put down the magnifying glass and get back to work thanks for watching [Music]",

track my workout drive somewhere new open my garage turn on my lights and adjust my thermostat all that power in the palm of my hands now my phone can perform a new trick using the cisco business mobile app this app can make setup and management of my network a simple task before i get started it's important to note that the devices i use with the app are new or factory reset cisco business switches and wireless access points other devices can run on the network but they cannot be managed from the application in future releases new features new cisco business devices and more configuration options will be added that's what's great about apps they're always being updated and improved in this tech talk i'll use the cisco business mobile app to do the initial setup and configuration of cisco business switches and wireless access points next i've downloaded the app on my phone and my devices are plugged into my network so i'm ready to roll i'll add a site and set up the configuration i want on my network devices the application will discover my cisco business devices and apply the configuration settings to start i'll open the cisco business mobile app the first thing that pops up is the option to create your first site where i'll name my network and set a location i'll click add site in the upper right hand corner of the screen next i'll tap on get started the app uses location services to determine my address i need to enter a name for the site i'll name my site lab when i scroll down i can see my location if the address is incorrect or i need to make changes i could tap inside of here and edit as needed i'll just go ahead and tap next the setup wizard is going to prompt me for site credentials these are the credentials for the site not for the application i'll put in the username i want my devices to use and then enter a password you may notice that the next button is not illuminated it will stay that way until the password and password confirmation match to show that i'll add an extra character to my password once they don't match the next button is dimmed until i remove that extra character i'll select next and i'm brought to the summary screen if i needed to make any changes i could tap on edit and make changes as needed everything looks good to me so i'll go ahead and tap on add site the site has been added so i'll click done time for the exciting part getting our gear set up i'll move on to setting the site configuration by tapping start site configuration then i'll tap get started the first question is regarding wireless do i want the application to configure a wireless network in this example i have a cbw ap that's ready to be configured so i'll be doing the wireless setup it should be noted that if i had an ap that either wasn't supported by the app such as a wab 581 or web 125 i could use those to connect into my network i just can't configure or manage them from the app if this is your situation connect them to the cisco business switch select no and continue the network configuration for the wired network in this case i have a cisco business ap so i'll answer yes the next question asks if i want to set up multiple networks you can think of this as being like multiple vlans where traffic is separated into different groups for example you may not want guest network users to be able to access devices containing your sensitive information such as banking or accounting for this demonstration i'm just going to say one is fine i'm directed to the advanced settings page which includes setting up a domain name system dns network time protocol ntp and dynamic host configuration protocol also known as dhcp optionally i can do them on my own and manually configure them but in this case i'll select do it automatically i'll tap continue since i only have one network i'll enter the network id as one i'm going to enter the name lab and then select next moving right along it's time for my wireless setup on my screen you will see a plus symbol if i click on that i could add another wireless network i'm going to go ahead and delete that one since i only want to run one wireless network it's going to show type as employee i'll enter my passphrase and then select next and next one more time i'm presented with a summary of the settings that i've entered if i needed to make a change i could tap on edit and make changes to the network segment which would be the wired network or the wireless it all looks good so i'll tap confirm site configuration and then done i'll select add devices and then get started this will get me connected to my network to configure my devices since i previously configured the app to do a wireless setup it's going to want to connect to cisco business setup this is the current ssid which is the default name of the network i'll tap join it's now connected to the ssid i'll tap done it's going to perform device discovery on that ssid here it sees my access point which is a 145 ac i'll tap add it shows me a summary of the settings that would be applied i'll confirm add device and now it's going to configure that access point this will take several minutes now that it's configured the access point the mobile app wants to join the wireless network lab i'll tap on join this may take a few minutes once the confirmation of deployment appears i'll see the option to add other devices this is a great option but instead of choosing that i want to show you a different way to deploy your devices so i will select done this brings me to the main page for my site from here i will show you the other way to add devices i'll select add devices go to get started and it will detect the cisco business devices that are out there nice i can see that it found three cisco business switches on my network i have a cbs250 220 and 350. i'll go ahead and scroll down to the bottom of the page and then tap on add these three devices it's going to show me which devices are going to be added and then i'll click to add and deploy devices it will start configuring those switches since these switches are either brand new or have been factory reset they're ready for initial configuration once it is complete i'll click done just like that my network is up and running no magic spells required from this point on i can manage these cisco business devices all from the app on my phone thanks for watching this tech talk i'll see you next time [Music]",

sure you don't miss an employee birthday sorry jeff to be in sync you'll have to configure your network switch in this cisco tech talk we're going to configure and sync system time in our cisco business 250 and 350 series switches using a simple network time protocol server in unicast mode next first we'll log into the switch providing the username and password then click on the login button once we're logged into the switch head to the upper right drop-down where it says basic and change it to advanced on this switch currently the latest firmware version 3.1.0.57 is installed under the system summary option we can verify this now to configure the time settings on this switch we'll navigate to the administration menu under the time settings menu we'll select the system time option here we can see that under clock source settings main clock source sntp server option is enabled this needs to be enabled so that it can sync the time from any sntp server the actual time from smtp server is showing along with the date and time zone offset we can also see the last synchronized server is reflecting here the mode is showing unicast and stratum level is showing one the stratum level defines the distance from a reference clock source if we look at the manual settings we can see that under time zone settings we have two options to get the time zone via dhcp or we can select the time zone offset manually from the drop down menu we'll need to make sure that we are selecting the correct time zone as per our location and we'll need to specify the time zone acronym as well we also have the option to configure daylight savings settings let's enable that and select the appropriate daylight saving time based on the region if we don't need this setting we can just uncheck the checkbox once we finalize the settings on this page we can click apply to save the settings let's move on to the sntp unicast page we need to make sure that the sntp client unicast is enabled the main clock source sntp server must be enabled for sntp client unicast to operate we can see that main clock source sntp servers is currently enabled and we can also see that ipv4 source interface and ipv6 source interface are set to auto we can select the ipv4 source vlan interface and ipv6 source vlan interface from the drop down menu under the unicast sntp server table we can see multiple servers are added apart from the default one and the server is successfully syncing the time also stratum levels are showing for their respective smtp servers click on the add button to add the sntp server on this page we'll need to select the server definition either by ip address or by name we'll select name for this example next we'll need to enter the sntp server domain name we'll enable the poll interval and we'll click the apply button to save our changes when we close the window we can see that the newly added sntp server is reflecting here on the page now the sntp servers added on this page are fully qualified domain names we'll need to make sure from this switch that we can resolve those domain names in order to do that we need to confirm the dns settings or domain name system settings are enabled on this switch to verify that go to the general ipconfiguration menu and select the dns settings option under the dns menu here we can see that dns settings are currently enabled holding retries pulling time out and polling interval are configured with default parameters under the dns server table we can see the dns server is learning via dhcp ipv4 in vlan1 interface we can also add the dns server under dns server table here to do this we'll click on the add button then we need to select ipversion either version 6 or version 4. we'll choose version 4 and we'll enter the dns server ip address so in this case we are entering the cisco umbrella dns server and we'll need to select the preference from the drop down menu to add another dns server again we'll select version 4 and we'll specify the cisco umbrella dns server again for the preference select two this time and click on apply now we'll close the window and we can see that the newly added dns servers are reflecting on the dns server table to save the settings on this switch we'll click this blinking floppy disk sign at the top of our screen we'll then navigate to the time settings page then system time and see that it is now synchronized through a different sntp server mode is showing unicast and stratum level is showing three in case we need to bring the sntp server details to the default settings then we need to navigate to sntp unicast page under time settings and click on the restore default servers option we will click ok on the confirmation pop-up window now we can see that only default sntp servers are reflecting under the unicast smtp server table we can also see that system time is now synchronized with a different sntp server [Music] now we're in sync now you know how to configure the system time on a cisco business 250 or 350 series switch thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time [Music]",

        "transcript": "we all have problems what's important is that when they arise we know how to solve them in this cisco tech talk we're going to perform an rv 340 series router ran 2 routing example with troubleshooting next before we start we'll need a roadmap of our network this is the network topology we'll use for this example as we can see there are two routers router 1 and router 2. the wan one interface of both routers is connected to the internet that allows the vlan 1 traffic of each router to have internet access we can see that both routers when twos are connected to the wan service provider router in our example we're going to divert the lan traffic of vlan 1 from router 2 through the wan2 link toward router 1's vlan 1 interface we'll configure both routers and the wan service provider router in this scenario router 2 is connected to the wan service provider router with the 70.0.0.0.30 private ip connectivity router 1 is connected to the wan service provider router with the 40.0.0.0.30 ipconnectivity there are two hosts connected on the routers on router 1 192.168.2 on router 2 192.168.170.109 we'll check the reachability from this host on router 2 to this host on router 1. then we'll verify that the traffic from the hosts are forwarding through the wan2 interface of the router 1 and 2. [Music] we'll start by configuring router 1. 192.168.200.1 is the vlan 1 ip log into the router on the status and statistics page we'll be able to see the firmware information 1.0.03.21 scroll down and we can see that wan1 and wan2 are both connected up and configured with an ip address wan one is already configured with a public ip and providing internet access [Music] when two is configured with the ip settings and is connected to the wan service provider on this router we have to configure the static routing to forward the traffic to the next hop interface this is the lan ipool 192.168.170.0 of the router 2. we are forwarding to the next hop interface that is configured on the wan service provider router that is 40.0.0.2 via the wan2 interface and for the other side of the wan link network we are forwarding the traffic to the next hop interface 40.0.0.2 via wan2 interface while we are configuring the static routing of the wan2 we need to disable its nat functionality navigate to access rules allow traffic from wan2 to the vlan 1 interface 4001 and 4002 our default in this rv 340 series router we need to allow this rule manually navigate to basic settings where we have disabled the firewall settings currently for troubleshooting [Music] however we can enable that one and verify the services based on the requirement to see the routing table we can navigate to status and statistics click on the routing table and it will show the available routes on this router we'll now check router 2. log in and we'll see the firmware details this is updated with 1.0.03.21 both the wan interfaces are connected up and configured with the ip when one is configured with the public ip and providing the internet connectivity wan 2 is configured with our private ip as mentioned on the network topology we've added the static route to forward the traffic of the router 1 land traffic towards the next hop interface that is configured on the wan service provider router also for the other side 30ip link that is 40.0.0.0 we're forwarding that traffic to the next hop interface 70.0.0.1 both are via the wan2 interface and metrics are configured as one navigate to firewall settings and check our network address translation we can see that we've disabled the nat functionality on the wan 2. when one is doing the natting to provide the internet connectivity to the vlan 1 users and through win2 link we are using static routing to forward the traffic to the other site router also we've allowed traffic from wan2 to vlan 1. we need to configure this manually we've disabled the firewall settings under the basic settings for troubleshooting purposes we can verify that this router is getting the internet connectivity we can ping any public domain name or ip and we can see that it is getting a reply from that domain now we'll navigate to the wan service provider router we're using a cisco business rv 340 series router once we log in we can see that this one is upgraded with the 1.0.03.21 firmware we'll see both wayn interfaces are connected wan 1 is connected to router 1 and wan 2 is connected to router 2. we've configured the static route accordingly on this wan service provider router for router 1 lan traffic it's forwarding it to 40.0.0.1 via the lan 1 interface the lan traffic of the router 2 192.168.170. is forwarding the traffic to the 70.0.0.2 via the wan2 interface let's verify the reachability this system 192.168.170.109 is connected to the router 2 lan interface we can also see that under dhcp binding we can also check on the other side router dhcp bindings and we'll see there's a host connected 192.1 we'll verify the reachability of this host 192.168.200.107 from the host 192.168.170.109 ping 192.168.200.107 it's able to reach the other site network to verify how it's reaching we'll use the tracert command and provide the ip of that remote site system we'll see how the traffic is navigating from this system via the wan2 link to the other site the first hop will be the lan interface of this router that is 192.168.17 then the traffic is reaching at the wan service provider router wan interface that is 70.0.0.1 then the traffic is reaching the wan2 interface of the router 1. that is 40.0.0.1 and finally it's reaching the destination 192.168.200.107. we can also verify the other device's reachability like we can verify the reachability of the vlan 1 network of the router 1. it is pinging we can verify the wan2 interface ip of the remote side router we can verify the wan ip of the wan service provider router as well we can also verify the other side link reachability in case any of these routes are missing on the wan service provider side then the reachability will be lost on the wam service provider router we need to make sure every necessary route is configured also we can troubleshoot this by using wan packet capture on our wan 2 in router 1. we'll start the packet capture and ping the router 1 wan2 interface we can ping router 1's lan interface then ping the host connected on the router 1 vlan 1 interface let's stop the packet capture and click export to see our results we can save the file or open it using wireshark to verify the ping reply we'll filter with the icmp protocol we can see the request and reply from the system this is the system from 192.168.170.109 that has initiated the request and is getting a reply to the wan2 interface of router 1. we can also see the request from the lan interface also we can see the reply from the host system as well this is how we configure and verify the static routing via the wan2 interface in cisco business rv 340 series routers problem solved thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time [Music]",

additional access points or mesh extenders is a snap and can be done right through your cisco business dashboard in this cisco tech talk we'll show you how to use your cbd with your cisco business wireless next [Music] first we'll log into the cisco business dashboard we'll enter our username and password and log in okay we're in there are several things we should see on the screen but the main thing we'll focus on is the access point and device deployed for this example we're using the cbd 2.2.2 version let's go to the network menu where we can see which network is deployed branch one network is configured under cbd main office organization click on branch 1 and we'll see that cbw 140 ac is connected with the cisco business 250 switch and that's it on the right we'll find the primary ap function that controls the wireless network click on view to access the wireless network we're in we have access to the cvw access point we'll click on the login button we'll be prompted once more for our username and password click ok and we should be logged into the cisco business wireless network on the main page we should see that we're in the cbw 140 ac we can also see wireless network access points active clients connected and rogue ap details let's go to the management tab and select software update we can see the current firmware version on this access point 10.4.1 under the advanced settings click snmp we should see the snmp service is enabled we'll need to make sure that this service is enabled so that it can communicate to cisco business dashboard we'll also need to make sure that snmp access version 2c and version 3 are enabled we can see that read only community and read write community are configured [Music] scroll down and we'll see the snmp version 3 user details let's visit our cbd settings page we can see that the connection status is down these cisco business dashboard settings are required for direct management where there's no cbd probe configured on the network if we need to enable this setting we'll first need to provide the information requested below once we finalize we'll need to click save let's head back to our cisco business dashboard home page [Music] home sweet home to see more details about our cbw deployment head to the inventory tab this is where you can find access point details click on any of the host names to learn more about that device in this case it is a cbw140ac we can see the model number mac address and its ip details complete piv vid the serial number the vendor's name the device group associated with branch network organization name firmware version and discovery method the protocols that are enabled on this access point we'll head to the dashboard tab where we can see information like the client count and traffic slot 0 is currently selected if we choose gigabit ethernet we can see the traffic for that interface [Music] we can see 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz traffic for their respective ssids if we scroll down further we can see the cpu utilization the notification details the uptime associated client details and the rogue ap under the pnp tab we can select the image we need to upload to this access point cisco business wireless 140 ac we can also upload configuration right now nothing is added here so it's not reflecting if we go to the wireless lan tab we can see several wireless configuration parameters for radio 0 and radio 1. scrolling downward we can see the ssid configured in 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz as well as the associated clients in each ssid and under the config backups tab we can see that currently there is no data to display and there's no backup configured however we can click on this backup configuration button to backup the device configuration under the pending configuration tab we can see apply appended configuration accept current configuration and read current configuration options there are a few colors that highlight the different types of configurations such as a red color to indicate a removed configuration green for a replaced configuration and blue for an added configuration when we navigate to the event log tab that's where we can see events happen on the cbw 140 ac device we can see the cpu utilization here as well as the reachability status and the time interval we can also head to the reports menu and select the wireless network currently cisco sbssid is selected so it is displaying that data if we choose the cbd demo ssid that is configured on the cbw network we can see the client count and the traffic details for those clients we can see the details based on days weeks months etc we can also filter the organization from this drop down in the top right corner and we can specify the wireless network that we are looking for scrolling down we'll see the specific ssid and client count peak details as well as other details like client count average traffic peak and traffic average for each ssid diving deeper we'll see spectrum usage client counts and traffic details we can also find radio frequency network organization and peaks and averages for client count and traffic we will also see wireless access point details including various time intervals we'll also notice the rogue ap details near to our cbw 140 ac device we can note the average signal strength of the channel used right here under the wireless client report page we can see the wireless client count the detailed data rate and the ssid name we can also find usage such as upload and download details and the maximum data rate we can also view the uptime such as how long users are online we'll also be able to see wireless guest details right now there is no guest associated so this data is not reflecting we can also add the new wireless network on cisco business wireless from cisco business dashboard to do that we'll need to navigate to the network configuration menu and select the wireless lan option here we can see that the cbd demo ssid is showing on the cisco business wireless access point cbw140ac we'll add a new wireless network here under the wireless lan option click the add button to create a new ssid we'll enter the profile name as new ssid we'll choose the organization from the drop-down in this case cbd main office now we need to choose the device group we'll choose cbd main office and drag that to the right side back under the wireless lan option we'll click add to create the ssid and we'll give it the name new cbw ssid next we'll choose the radio interface from the drop down we can choose from 2.4 gigahertz 5 gigahertz or both interfaces we'll choose both for this example we'll then need to specify the vlan id as well and enable and broadcast options to enable the wireless lan under the security option we'll choose wpa2 personal from the dropdown this is supported in cisco business wireless so we need to provide the passphrase key finally we'll click save [Music] we can see that a newly added ssid is reflecting here click save to configure this wireless network in cisco business wireless from this cisco business dashboard yes the job was created successfully and now we can see the done with success status the ssid has been configured we can verify this by checking the cisco business wireless ap go to wireless settings and click on the wlans option on this page we can see that the newly created ssid new cbw ssid is reflecting here through time the needs of your network can change isn't it great to know that cisco business dashboard helps make changes simple and easy

talk we'll walk through some of the most commonly used functions for the command line interface on cbs 350 and 250 switches next in this demo we'll cover the gamut of cli commands including creating a host name a username and password disabling and enabling smart ports globally configuring a static ip on vlan 1 configuring multiple vlans configuring access and trunk ports for vlans and finally saving our configuration to the switch's startup config as you can see we're already connected to our switch with a terminal let's start by logging into the switch we'll first notice that the hostname of the switch is in the first line on the command prompt in order to change this we'll need to be in global configuration mode we'll start by typing configuration and hit enter this will take us into the global configuration mode next we'll type hostname and the name that we would like to assign to the switch in this case we'll use switch 3. we can also verify this by exiting out of the global configuration mode by typing either exit or end and performing a show command in this case show system next let's create a user who can log into the switch as an administrator first we'll enter the global configuration mode from here we simply start typing username then the name of the user we want to create in this case we'll create tim now add the command password and after that type the password you want to use at this point we can choose whether or not to encrypt the password if we hit the space bar and add a question mark we'll be shown available commands for this example we'll use the sha-512 for our encryption on the password we can also change the privilege to assign the user as an administrator they will need both read and write privileges we'll enter privilege for this command followed by control question mark we'll have the option of privilege one privilege 7 in privilege 15. privilege level 1 is meant for basic users with just read only rights privilege 15 includes read and write access for this example we'll choose 15. we've now created this user and can once again exit out typing exit will log us out of the switch we will now log back in with our newly created user from here we can select show users command to see that tim has logged in on the serial location for 30 seconds much of the information we might need on a switch can be ascertained by entering the show running configuration command and tapping enter this will show us the configuration of the switch which currently is set as default configuration we'll see our hostname we've created as well as our users with password encryption most of our switches come with what's called smart port what this does is allow the switch to determine what is physically plugged into its ports and based on macros that are configured it will auto configure the port auto configuring can sometimes cause headaches if we're not aware of the specifics of how it works to help alleviate this we can disable our smart port to do so we'll enter our global configuration mode and simply type macro auto disabled and then enter to turn this back on later we'd simply run the same command and follow it up by typing enable and to set the switch to default settings type no macro auto next we'll add a static ip address to vlan 1 on the switch first we'll enter our global configuration mode and type interface vlan 1. our command will begin with our ip address in this case 172.19.76.4 followed by our subnet mask in this case 255.255.255.0. from here we can take a look at our configuration with the show command to execute an exec level command from global configuration mode or any configuration sub-mode use the do command we'll type the word do first followed by show running configuration we can now see that interface vlan 1 has our ip address assigned to it no ip address dhcp simply means we are not pulling an ip address dynamically next let's talk configuring vlans while in our global configuration mode we'll type vlan 20 to start we also have the option to create a vlan in this case vlan 30 by typing the command interface vlan 30. this command will also take us into the vlan interface allowing us to configure the interface directly typing in command do show vlan we'll now see that we've created vlan 20 and vlan 30. if we want to add a name to the vlan we can do that here as well type name and then the name you would like to call the vlan for this example we're going to call it data to switch back and forth between the vlans type interface vlan 20. from here we can change the name of our other vlan which we'll call voice [Music] now for a pro tip to find commonly or frequently used commands simply use your up and down arrow keys to cycle through previously typed commands [Music] next up we'll configure an interface as an access port for both vlan 20 and vlan 30. to do this we'll access port 10. we'll type interface g1 0 10 for port 10 and create an access port by typing switchport mode access next we'll assign it to a vlan by typing switchboard access vlan 20. subsequently we'll change interface 11 to vlan 30. by using our arrow keys we'll bring up the command to enter interface and change it to 11. as you can see we are currently in the interface g1 0-11 and we can cycle through to our switchboard mode access and switchboard access feeling 20 simply deleting 20 and adding 30. we can verify this once again with the command show vlan we can see now that port 10 is on vlan 20 as untagged along with port 11 on vlan 30 as untagged still with me great to round things out we'll walk through creating a trunk port we'll enter interface 12 and in this case instead of using a command to switch port mode access we're going to use the command switch port mode trunk to assign the vlans we'll enter the command to switch port trunk along vlan and use 1 20 and 30. we'll also need to add a native vlan which is the untagged vlan for the trunk we'll type switchport trunk native vlan and in this case we are using vlan 1. we can verify our changes by using show vlan and we'll see that port 12 is tagged vlan 20 and 30 and port 12 is untagged vlan 1. the command show running configuration will allow us to see that we have configured multiple ports as access ports or trunk ports as well as which vlans are allowed the final step saving the configuration we'll type exit and hit enter twice and type the command copy running configuration startup configuration this is so that when the switch reboots the saved changes will be applied we'll be asked to confirm yes or no to finalize the changes and that's a rundown of the basics of cli commands for cbs 350 and 250 switches thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time

        "transcript": "yes i'll need that on my desk by monday no excuses listen having a commanding presence is everything in business and network it management is no exception in this cisco tech talk we'll walk through some of the most commonly used functions for the command line interface on cbs 350 and 250 switches next in this demo we'll cover the gamut of cli commands including creating a host name a username and password disabling and enabling smart ports globally configuring a static ip on vlan 1 configuring multiple vlans configuring access and trunk ports for vlans and finally saving our configuration to the switch's startup config as you can see we're already connected to our switch with a terminal let's start by logging into the switch we'll first notice that the hostname of the switch is in the first line on the command prompt in order to change this we'll need to be in global configuration mode we'll start by typing configuration and hit enter this will take us into the global configuration mode next we'll type hostname and the name that we would like to assign to the switch in this case we'll use switch 3. we can also verify this by exiting out of the global configuration mode by typing either exit or end and performing a show command in this case show system next let's create a user who can log into the switch as an administrator first we'll enter the global configuration mode from here we simply start typing username then the name of the user we want to create in this case we'll create tim now add the command password and after that type the password you want to use at this point we can choose whether or not to encrypt the password if we hit the space bar and add a question mark we'll be shown available commands for this example we'll use the sha-512 for our encryption on the password we can also change the privilege to assign the user as an administrator they will need both read and write privileges we'll enter privilege for this command followed by control question mark we'll have the option of privilege one privilege 7 in privilege 15. privilege level 1 is meant for basic users with just read only rights privilege 15 includes read and write access for this example we'll choose 15. we've now created this user and can once again exit out typing exit will log us out of the switch we will now log back in with our newly created user from here we can select show users command to see that tim has logged in on the serial location for 30 seconds much of the information we might need on a switch can be ascertained by entering the show running configuration command and tapping enter this will show us the configuration of the switch which currently is set as default configuration we'll see our hostname we've created as well as our users with password encryption most of our switches come with what's called smart port what this does is allow the switch to determine what is physically plugged into its ports and based on macros that are configured it will auto configure the port auto configuring can sometimes cause headaches if we're not aware of the specifics of how it works to help alleviate this we can disable our smart port to do so we'll enter our global configuration mode and simply type macro auto disabled and then enter to turn this back on later we'd simply run the same command and follow it up by typing enable and to set the switch to default settings type no macro auto next we'll add a static ip address to vlan 1 on the switch first we'll enter our global configuration mode and type interface vlan 1. our command will begin with our ip address in this case 172.19.76.4 followed by our subnet mask in this case 255.255.255.0. from here we can take a look at our configuration with the show command to execute an exec level command from global configuration mode or any configuration sub-mode use the do command we'll type the word do first followed by show running configuration we can now see that interface vlan 1 has our ip address assigned to it no ip address dhcp simply means we are not pulling an ip address dynamically next let's talk configuring vlans while in our global configuration mode we'll type vlan 20 to start we also have the option to create a vlan in this case vlan 30 by typing the command interface vlan 30. this command will also take us into the vlan interface allowing us to configure the interface directly typing in command do show vlan we'll now see that we've created vlan 20 and vlan 30. if we want to add a name to the vlan we can do that here as well type name and then the name you would like to call the vlan for this example we're going to call it data to switch back and forth between the vlans type interface vlan 20. from here we can change the name of our other vlan which we'll call voice [Music] now for a pro tip to find commonly or frequently used commands simply use your up and down arrow keys to cycle through previously typed commands [Music] next up we'll configure an interface as an access port for both vlan 20 and vlan 30. to do this we'll access port 10. we'll type interface g1 0 10 for port 10 and create an access port by typing switchport mode access next we'll assign it to a vlan by typing switchboard access vlan 20. subsequently we'll change interface 11 to vlan 30. by using our arrow keys we'll bring up the command to enter interface and change it to 11. as you can see we are currently in the interface g1 0-11 and we can cycle through to our switchboard mode access and switchboard access feeling 20 simply deleting 20 and adding 30. we can verify this once again with the command show vlan we can see now that port 10 is on vlan 20 as untagged along with port 11 on vlan 30 as untagged still with me great to round things out we'll walk through creating a trunk port we'll enter interface 12 and in this case instead of using a command to switch port mode access we're going to use the command switch port mode trunk to assign the vlans we'll enter the command to switch port trunk along vlan and use 1 20 and 30. we'll also need to add a native vlan which is the untagged vlan for the trunk we'll type switchport trunk native vlan and in this case we are using vlan 1. we can verify our changes by using show vlan and we'll see that port 12 is tagged vlan 20 and 30 and port 12 is untagged vlan 1. the command show running configuration will allow us to see that we have configured multiple ports as access ports or trunk ports as well as which vlans are allowed the final step saving the configuration we'll type exit and hit enter twice and type the command copy running configuration startup configuration this is so that when the switch reboots the saved changes will be applied we'll be asked to confirm yes or no to finalize the changes and that's a rundown of the basics of cli commands for cbs 350 and 250 switches thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time

our network that we want to manage the probe discovers the network collects performance and configuration data from the discovered devices and reports that information back to the dashboard [Music] the first thing we'll do is download the cisco business dashboard probe software for vmware from cisco website to do this we'll navigate to the cisco business dashboard support page which is referenced in the description of this video once on the page we'll go to the downloads tab under probe software we'll click on the download options we need to locate the download option for virtual machine image for vmware and click the download icon in this case we are downloading the 2.3.0 probe version now we need to make sure we have a working vmware virtualization environment available to host the virtual machine in this case we are using the esxi version 7.0.0 to create the virtual machine we'll click on the create or register vm option then we'll select the deploy a virtual machine from an ovf or ova file option as we have downloaded the probe virtual machine image in signed over file format and click next here we will enter a name for the virtual machine we will use cbd underscore 2.3.0 underscore new underscore pro now we'll go ahead and click on the click to select files or drag drop option locate the profile that we have just downloaded and click open then go ahead and click on next we need to select a data store for the virtual machine in this case store 1 is selected by default we will keep the same and click next again now we need to select the deployment options we will leave the default settings here and hit next here we can verify the settings everything looks good so we'll click on finish we can see the process has started now under recent tasks this process will take some time to complete we need to make sure the network interface on the newly created virtual machine is connected and bridged to the correct physical interface on the host machine the network interface of the cisco business dashboard probe should be connected to a vlan containing the management interfaces for at least one of the network devices if the probe is not directly connected to at least one network device it may be unable to fully discover the network once the tasks result shows as completed successfully we will go ahead and click on the name of the virtual machine we just created we can see the virtual machine is powered on currently now we will click on the console we need to enter the login which is cisco and then the password which is cisco as well all lowercase and hit enter we will need to change the password now for the login cisco we will enter cisco for the current password and then type in our new password and hit enter we need to retype the new password again so we will enter the same password again and hit enter we need to repeat the same process one more time we will do that now we can see the cisco business dashboard probe has been initialized and the administration gui ip is reflecting now we will open a browser and enter the administration gui ip address to access the cisco business dashboard probe gui we will likely get a page that looks similar to this your connection is not private this page is appearing since the probe has a self-signed certificate on it initially so this screen is normal we will click on advanced and then select proceed to 172.16.1.170. here we need to enter the username which is cisco and password which again is cisco all lowercase now we need to update the login information and change the default user we need to select a username we want to use in this case we'll use admin then we will enter the old password which is cisco all lowercase and then type in the new password and retype the new password and click save now we'll get the option to establish the dashboard connection we can skip that option as well but in this case we'll go ahead and enter the ip address of the cisco business dashboard manager we wish to connect to this probe and click finish we can also use a domain name here if we're using a domain name then we need to make sure that the probe will need to be able to resolve the domain name now we need to enter the username and password for cisco business dashboard to authenticate and click login here we need to enter the name of the network as well as the location to associate or create a network and then click finish now we can see that the cisco business dashboard has been connected with the domain we've specified also we'll be able to see the different options available under administration menu in cisco business dashboard probe on the cisco business dashboard manager we will navigate to network menu and we can see the newly created network we will click on that network name to see the network topology and that's all there is to it that's how we can set up the cisco business dashboard probe 2.3.0 in vmware esxi thanks for

        "transcript": "switches are an essential component of any local area network and managing these devices from a single user interface can be a big help get started managing your cbs 220 devices from within cisco business dashboard or cvd and get yourself a little help direct management enables the management of a single device without needing a probe on the local network cisco business dashboard version 2.3.0 supports direct management of the cbs220 series switch as it lacks performance to support an embedded probe in this cisco tech talk we'll talk about how direct management works for cbs 220 series switches the first thing we'll do is log into the switch by using our username and password then click login if the cisco business dashboard is using a self-signed certificate where we are trying to connect to the cbs220 switch for direct management then we must import the certificate from cisco business dashboard to the cbs220 switch otherwise it will not trust the source in case the cisco business dashboard uses a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority then we shouldn't need to perform this step to import the certificate we will scroll down the page and choose the security menu then we will scroll down again to certificate settings and choose that then select ca certificate settings this is where we will import the certificate from the cisco business dashboard now to get the certificate details we will open cisco business dashboard and enter our username and password and click login from here we will go to system menu then choose certificate now we will scroll down the page and click download to download the certificate we need to note the cisco business dashboard ip address here and write it down or copy it into a notepad as we will need that in a little bit and then save file and click ok next we need to get the access key id and access key secret to do so we will go back to the menu and choose administration and then users once in here we'll go ahead and click on admin scroll down and click on the generate access key we need to enter in a description we'll use cbs220 we can also specify the expiration date or choose never we'll just leave it as the default and click save this generates an access key id and secret we need to make sure to either write these down or copy and paste them because we will need them shortly now we need to go back into the switch click on the plus symbol under the ca certificate table here we need to name the certificate we'll use cisco we also need to enter the owner details which will be cisco in this instance as well then we need the certificate itself we'll go ahead and open the file we just downloaded to a notepad scroll down to where it says begin certificate and highlight the entire section be sure to highlight the beginning and end of the certificate then copy this using your keyboard or mouse and paste it into the certificate section here and click apply [Music] now we will scroll up the page and click on the administration menu and select cbd settings options we will click on the enable check box next to call home agent enabled we can change the call home agent log level here for this example we will use notice here we will go ahead and click on the check box to enable the dashboard connection next for server definition we will click the radio button by ip address now here we will enter the ip address for the cisco business dashboard which is the same as the one we wrote down or copied earlier the dashboard port is defaulted to 443 we'll go ahead and keep that now we'll need to enter our organization name which we've created on the cisco business dashboard and the network name as well now we'll need the access key id in the secret we also wrote down or copied earlier we'll go ahead and enter those values here then click on apply we should see a green checkbox style notification indicating it was successful when we refresh the page we will now see the connection status is now showing as up and the agent version showing as 2.3.0 now we'll be able to manage the cbs 220 switch directly from the cisco business dashboard that's all there is to it we are now set up to get the best from our cbs 220 device that's how direct management works for cbs 220 series switches thanks for watching this cisco tech talk we'll see you next time",

cisco business 250 series smart switches are the way to go they provide ideal solutions at an affordable price that's perfect for any home or small business in this video we'll talk about some of the features of the cbs 250 and walk through a few configurations next first let's talk about the global leds found on our device the system led lights flash green when the switch is powered on booting performing self-tests or acquiring an ip address if the light ever flashes amber though the switch has detected hardware or firmware failure or a configuration file error to access a switch with a web-based interface we've got to know the ip address the switch is using switches use the default factory ip address of 192.168.1.254 with a subnet of 24. when the switch is using the default ip address the system led flashes continuously when the switch is using a dhcp server assigned ip address or an administrator has configured a static id address the system led is a steady green and the dhcp is enabled by default it's time to log in cisco spell lowercase is our default username and password once inside we'll be prompted to change our username and password we'll do so now under the dashboard the cbs250 offers a simple intuitive dashboard that powers the deployment monitoring and life cycle management of our switches here we can see the resource utilization graph as well as the system health display and ram memory logs this product supports many more features therefore the web gui includes hundreds of configurations and display pages these pages are divided into basic and advanced display modes the advanced mode offers a full set of configuration options when the user switches from basic to advanced the browser page will reload [Music] now let's go through the getting started section this will guide us through how to install and manage our device we can use the various links and follow the on-screen instructions to quickly configure our switch [Music] we'll go to the configuration wizards next here we can go through a quick and easy configuration wizard after the initial setup wizard we'll enter in the system location and contact we can also use the default host name or define our own once that's finished we'll click next then we'll create a new ip interface we can choose the none option to keep the current configuration on the next page we can change the username and password for this example we'll select to keep the current username and password on the next page we can set up the system clock from the smtp server or we can import the time from our local computer we'll click next and hit apply to save our changes now we'll navigate to the vlan configuration wizard we can choose the interface we'd like to use as the trunk interface in this instance we'll use port 1 since it is the port connected to our router we can also create a new vlan on the next page we'll create vlan 20 and name it admin on the next page we'll choose port 1 as the trunk port that will pass vlan 20 on trunk traffic after that we can also add access interface to vlan 20. for this example we'll choose ports 13 through 16. to finish up we'll click apply to save [Music] there's also a configuration wizard that can allow for an acl configuration but we'll leave that for another video if we head over to administration and file management we'll find the firmware operations a file management system is an application that is used to store arrange and access the files that are on our device the system files contain information such as configuration information or firmware images various actions can be performed with these files like selecting the firmware file from which device boots modifying various types of configuration files internally or copying files to or from an external device such as an external server up next is the system log we'll go straight to the log settings this section describes the system logging which enables a device to generate multiple independent logs each of these logs is a set of messages describing system events this allows for a quick overview of events inside the switch's history this is a very handy tool for any home office or small business office the device generates the following logs local logs logs sent to the console interface logs written in a cyclical list of logged events in the ram and a race when device reboots and logs written in a cyclical log file saved to the flash memory and persisting across reboots in addition we can send messages to the remote syslog servers in the form of snmp traffics and slot messages another useful feature within the switch is the ping the ping utility will test if a remote host can be reached and measures the round-trip time for the packet sent ping operates by sending internet control messages protocol or icmp echo request packets to the target host and waits for an icmp response it measures a round trip time and records any packet loss if we activate ping we can see that we do not have internet connection we sent off four packets and none were received that is why our packet loss is now 100 this is a great way to test internet connectivity within the switch finally we'll talk about poe we're going to click on port management poe and then properties cisco business 250 series switches are available with as many as 48 power over ethernet ports this capability simplifies advanced technology deployments like ip telephones and wireless and ip surveillance by allowing us to connect and power network endpoints over a single ethernet cable this offers simplicity of use to any type of user there are many features within the cbs 250 such as smart port multicast access control list and qos which will be discussed in later videos thanks for getting to know the cisco business 250 series smart switch and for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see you next time",

        "transcript": "[Music] vlans are very helpful when it comes to separating a network but because we cannot delete vlan 1 which is the default vlan we need to do a little editing in this edition of tech talks we'll show you how to change the default native vlan on the cisco cbs350 switch next [Music] let's begin by heading to the vlan settings under vlan management here we can see our default or native vlan vlan 1. for this example we're going to create two new vlans we'll click on add to create a new vlan our vlan id will be 10 and our name will be admin the vlan interface state and link status snmp traps are enabled by default we'll keep those as is next we'll click apply to save for our second vlan we'll give it an id of 20 and a name of new native vlan we'll click apply to save before we can continue it's important to point out that our administrative vlan should be different than the native vlan our administrative vlan should carry management traffic such as ssh all right next we'll head over to port to vlan we can see under vlan id that we are under vlan 1 and that all ports are under vlan 1 2. [Music] under vlan id we're going to choose one of the vlans we created for this example it's vlan 10. we'll click go to move forward now we need to assign a port to the vlan in this example since our end device is connected to the switch at port 3 we will leave this port assigned to vlan 1 because we would lose connection to the switch also since our switch is currently connected to our router outport 1 we'll leave port 1 on vlan 1 for now let's add port 5 to vlan 10 we'll switch the membership type to untagged and then apply to save next we'll add a port to vlan 20. we'll change the vlan id to 20 and hit go again we'll leave port 1 and port 3 to vlan 1. we'll choose port 2 to add to vlan 20 since nothing is currently connected to port 2 we'll switch its type to untagged and then click apply to save once again next we're going to move to ipv4 interface under the ipv4 configurations tab here we can see our default vlan 1 ipv4 interface but we'll need to create new ipv4 interfaces for our new vlans we'll click on add to get started first we'll change the vlan to 10. here we can choose the dynamic ip address and the ipv4 address will be assigned from dhcp however it may be more beneficial to assign a static ip address so that it will be consistent and not change for this example we'll enter an rip address which is 10.15.10.10 and a network mask of 255.255.255.0 we'll click apply to save next we're going to add an ipv4 interface for vlan 20 which will be our new native vlan again we'll switch to vlan 20 select static ip address and enter in our information we'll click apply to save once we've created our new ipv4 interface for our new vlans we can delete the vlan 1 ipv4 interface it's important to do this only after we've created our new ipv4 interfaces if we were to delete it before creating the new ones we would be locked out and would have to factory reset the switch to delete vlan 1 we'll go ahead and select it and click on the delete icon once we've deleted vlan 1 we see that we are no longer connected to the switch that's because we have deleted the interface to which we were connected we can still access the switch since we've created new ipv4 interfaces for our new vlans however we'll need to change the ipv4 address on the end user to the subnet of the new ipv4 interface that we just created in this example we're using a pc on windows 10 so we can change the computer's ipv4 address by going to settings we'll click on network and internet and change adapter options here we can right-click on ethernet and choose properties we should see internet protocol version 4. double click it and make sure use the following ip address is chosen then enter in our ip address since we have an interface at 10.15.10.10 we must make sure that our pcip address will also be within that subnet here we changed our ip address to 10.15.10.5 which is in the same subnet as our ipv4 interface that we created we can now go ahead and click ok twice and then close out of that window next we can double check that our configuration was changed by checking in the command prompt under the command prompt we'll go ahead and enter ipconfig and enter it here we can see that our ip address did change to 10.15.10.5 if not we'll need to go back and change the ip address make sure that we remember that we are currently connected on port 3 on the switch which is still on vlan 1. we'll need to change the port to which our pc is connected it will need to be on a port that is in vlan 10 since that is the ipv4 interface to which we'll try to connect earlier we added port 5 to vlan 10 so we will now connect the pc to port 5 on that switch we'll open a new browser and enter the ipv4 address of our ipv4 interface that we created it's 10.15 we see here that the switch's gui has popped up we'll log back into the switch once we're inside we're going to click on vlan management and select port to vlan under the vln id we see that we are under vlan 1. if we scroll down we can see that we still have a lot of ports that are assigned to vlan 1. we need to assign these ports to vlan 20 because it is the new native vlan before we do that let's go ahead and click on the vlan id change it to 10 and click go here we can see that port 5 is currently in vlan 10. we need to remember that so we don't change that port in the future we'll leave that port as is now let's switch to vlan 20 click go we can now go ahead and assign all the ports that were on vlan 1 to vlan 20. we'll exclude vlan 10 though which was port 5 and untagged the rest of the ports once we're done assigning the rest of the ports to vlan 20 we'll click apply now we'll move on to port vlan membership here we see that all the ports are in vlan 20 with the exception of port 5. the next thing we'll have to do is change the native vlan on all ports to the new native vlan if we select our port and click join vlan we can edit the native vlan id under trunk mode membership currently this is set at vlan 1. we need to change that to 20. we'll click apply ideally we want all ports to have the same native vlan so we'll have to change all the ports once we've changed all ports we'll have successfully changed the default or native vlan on the switch thanks for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see you next time you",

350 is simple to deploy simple to manage and provides a solid foundation for business applications in this edition of tech talks we'll go over some of the features and configurations of the cbs350 next let's get started first we'll talk about the global leds found on the device system led lights flash steady green when the switch is powered on when booting when performing self-tests or acquiring an ip address if the led flashes amber the switch has detected a configuration file error or hardware or firmware failure to access the switch with the web-based interface you must know the ip address of the switch we're using the switch is using the factory default ip address of 192.168.1.254 the subnet of slash.4 when the switch is using the factory default ip address the system led flashes continuously when the switch is using a dhcp server assigned at the address or administrator has configured a static ip address the system led is a steady green dhcp is also enabled by default our default password and username will be cisco when we first log into the switch we will need to change the username and default password under dashboard the cbs offers simple intuitive dashboards and automates the deployment monitoring and lifecycle management of the switch we can see a resource utilization graph as well as the system health display and a brief glance at the ram logs stacking is available on the cbs 350 with as many as four switches it is available on 24 port and 48 port 4x models the product supports many features therefore the web gui includes hundreds of configuration and display modes these pages are divided into either basic or advanced now let's go through the getting started section this will guide us through how to install and manage our device we can use the various links and follow the on-screen instructions to quickly configure our switch we can enter the system location in the system contact next we can select the default host name or create a new one we can use this screen to create a new ip interface for the system choosing none will keep the current configurations we can keep or change the username and password on this screen next we can set the system clock from an smtp server or we can import the date and time from a local computer up next we'll demonstrate the vlan configuration wizard we can choose the interface that we would like to use as our trunk interface in this example we're going to use port 1 since this will be the port connected to our router we can also create a new vlan from this screen we'll create vlan 20 and name it admin we'll choose port 1 as a trunk port that will pass vlan 20 untake traffic we can also add access interfaces to vlan 20. we'll choose ports 13 through 16 as access ports for vlan 20. click apply to save there's also a configuration wizard for acl configuration but don't worry this topic will be discussed in another video [Music] we're now going to take a look at file management we'll click on administration choose file management and select firmware operations a file management system is an application that is used to store and arrange the access files that are on our device the system files contain information such as configuration info and firmware images a ton of actions can be performed with these files such as selecting the firmware file from which the device boots or modifying various types of configuration files internally we can also copy files to and from an external device we'll now go to the system log under administration we'll click on system log and log settings the system logs are enabled by default this section describes the system logging which enables a device to generate multiple independent logs each log is a set of messages describing system events the device generates the following local logs the logs sent to the console interface the logs written in a cyclical list of logged events in the ram and logs erased when the device reboots the logs written into a cyclical log file saved to the flash memory and persist across reboots in the remote log server we can send messages to remote syslog servers in the form of snmp traps and assist log messages another useful feature within the switch is the ping and it's located under administration the ping utility will test if the remote host can be reached and it measures the round trip for packet sent ping operates by sending internet control message protocols echo request packets to the target host and waits for icmp response enhanced security capabilities provide a solid foundation to safeguard the privacy of customers cisco business 350 series switches provide the advanced security features we need to protect our business data and keep unauthorized users off the network embedded secure socket layer ssl encryption for text management data traveling to and from the switch support for advanced network security applications such as the ieee 802.1 export security tightly limits access to a specific segment of our network the cisco business 350 series switches are available with as many as 40 power over ethernet ports this capability simplifies advanced technology deployments such as ip telephones and wireless and ip surveillance it does this by allowing users to connect and power network endpoints over a single ethernet cable and that's our walk through those are some of the features and configurations of the cbs 350. thanks for watching this edition of tech talks we'll see you next time",

connections are very useful since they create a vpn tunnel that allows users to access the network through vpn client software without compromising privacy or security they're a pretty nifty tool on this edition of tech talks we'll show how to set up a vpn connection with greenbow for client-to-site vpn next [Music] to start configuring the vpn we'll click on vpn and select ipsec profiles we'll go ahead and add a new ipsec profile here we can enter all its information we'll name it green underscore new for this example for our keying mode we'll leave it at auto we're also going to keep the ike version at ike version 1. for the phase 1 options we'll choose our dh group as group 2. encryption will be aes 128 for this example and our authentication will be sha-1 for the sa lifetime we will change it from the default to 86 400. now on to the phase two options we'll keep the protocol selection at dsp and change the encryption to aes 128. authentication will be shown 1 and we'll leave the sa lifetime at 3600. we've got perfect forward secrecy enabled now all we'll do is change the dh group to group 5 15 36 bits once finished we'll click apply to save our changes now we'll head over to client to site and click on add to create a new tunnel the first thing we're going to do on this new page is select third-party client next we can enable the tunnel and give it a name for this example we'll name it new underscore green bow for the interface option we must choose whichever one we're using for internet connection in this example we are using wan one the pre-shared key must be the same on the router as well as the client here we'll disable minimum pre-shared key complexity and show our pre-shared key for this example we're entering in green123 as our key under our local identifier we should have local wan ip and we should be able to see our public ip address in this example we cannot see the public ip address so we can choose ip address and add our public ip address to our configuration our remote identifier will be left as fqdn we can create the fqdn for the client in the next box we'll name it greenbowvpn.com for the pool range we'll create a private range for the clients our starting ip is 10.25.25.1 and the end ip is 10.25.25.30 this allows us to have 30 clients connected to this vpn next we're going to select the advanced settings tab to enter in some more settings under ipsec profile we're going to select the ipsec profile that we've created which was green underscore new our remote endpoint will be left as dynamic ip for the local group setup we'll select subnet for our local ip type and enter in the local subnet for our router for this example it's 192.168.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 under mode configuration we will leave all the settings as default now we'll click apply to save the changes we can now see our new tunnel at the bottom of the table great we have now finished configuring the client site configurations on router 345 it's now time to configure the greenbow vpn client we'll start by opening up the greenbow vpn next we'll need to right click on ikev1 and select new phase 1. we should now see the ikev1 gateway and we will open that it's time for some more settings our interface will be left as any and our remote gateway will be the public ip address of our rv router next we'll enter in our pre-shared key and confirm it as is and move down to cryptography the encryption will be aes120 the authentication will be shell one and finally the key group will be dh2 next we'll move over to the protocol tab the local id under identity will be dns we'll enter in the fqdm that we created on the rv greenbowvpn.com we'll then hop down to mode config and enable it we're going to move right along to the gateway settings we'll first change the lifetime to 86 400 seconds for the dead peer connection or dpd we're going to enter 15 seconds for the check interval 5 has the maximum number of retries and 15 seconds as the delay between retries we'll enter two for the retransmission to save our settings we'll go to configuration on the top left corner and select save we're going to right click on ipv1 gateway again and select new phase 2. now we can select ikev1 tunnel our address type will be the subnet address and we can enter in the subnet for our rv router our encryption will be aes128 the authentication will be sha-1 and the mode is tunnel alright then we'll enable the pfs and select dh5 for the group finally we can set the ipsec lifetime as 3600 to save these settings we'll go back to configuration on the top left corner and click save now that we've finished with the greenbow vpn client configuration we can open the tunnel we'll right click on ikev1 tunnel and select open tunnel when you see the seal you know it's real we now have our vpn connected and that's how to set up a vpn connection with the greenbow vpn client and rv340 series switch thanks for watching tech talks

rv340 logs next ipsec vpn or virtual private network allows you to securely obtain remote resources by establishing an encrypted tunnel across the internet to start things off we'll click on system configuration then select log first we'll need to make sure that the log is enabled we can leave the log buffer at the default value of 1024. for severity we'll choose the debugging for our category we'll choose all we'll go ahead and apply these changes next up we'll head over to status and statistics for a few fun facts on our vpn we'll choose to view logs for the category we'll deselect all and individually checked vpn and ssl vpn we're only going to be looking at vpn traffic for severity we'll stick with all okay so before we get too hasty and show those logs we'll have to make sure we try and establish a vpn connection first and foremost after that's done we'll move on and click on show logs after the logs pop up we'll see that our vpn connection failed when we search through the logs we can see messages that are failing our login forms say we have an invalid hash or psk pre-shared key an incorrect pre-shared key can cause a vpn connection to fail let's fix the pre-shared key and then see if we can establish a vpn connection you know how your parents always told you to look both ways before you cross the street the same applies here my friends we'll want to check both sides of the vpn tunnel to make sure that the key is the same on both sides after checking both sites we were able to see that on our client side the pre-shared key was incorrect once the correction was made the tunnel was able to be established again we can recheck the loss by clicking the refresh button we can now see that we were able to establish a vpn connection and that there are no longer any failed messages here we can see in our logs that our pre-shared keys match but the fun troubleshooting issues don't end there folks let's look at another common issue with the vpn connection let's go ahead and refresh the logs in the logs we still see an invalid hash or pre-shared key we know that the pre-shared keys are fine however as down here we see an invalid idv1 payload length decryption failed message this message could mean we have an ipsec profile mismatch this is most likely within the encryption if the encryption fails then so will the free shared key let's check our ipsec profile on both sides of the vpn to see if they match we'll click on the vpn option and choose ipsec profiles we'll go ahead and look at the profile that we are currently using for the vpn for this example it's green underscore pro okay after reviewing both ipsec profiles on both ends we can see that the encryption on the client side is set to 3ds while on the rv 340 the encryption is aes aes128 let's change the encryption on the client side and see if we can get this vpn back up and running after changing the encryption to match phase 1 aes 128 we'll check to see if the vpn is running all right under a green underscore vpn we have one connection which means we were able to connect again and the issue was with the encryption we'll return to the logs to make sure we don't have any other errors we'll have to click on show logs again after scrolling down we can see that there are no failed messages the vpn tunnel was a success here in the logs we can also see the pre-shared keys are matching alright the hits keep on coming let's check out another common issue we can go ahead and clear our logs and try to connect the vpn again once we try to connect we'll refresh the logs right now we don't see any traffic in our logs oftentimes when you don't see any logs it could be a sign that the router isn't receiving any vpn traffic to fix this we first want to make sure that both of the vpn ends have an internet connection if they do we can check the firewall on the router as well as on the pc we're working on to make sure no corresponding traffic is blocked another possible issue is having an incorrect public ip address when we check the client side we can see that the remote gateway is incorrect let's correct this and try again after correcting the public ip address on the client side we're able to successfully connect to the vpn i'll check the logs again here we can see our logs and we shouldn't see any failed messages since we were successful think we're done saving the day not so fast let's check out another common issue after we've tried to establish a vpn connection let's click refresh and look at the laws here we see our pre-shared key configs did match but we see no peer config found this message could point to an issue with either a local id or a remote id issue we're going to double check our configurations we'll click on vpn and then client to site format [Music] our vpn is green underscore vpn we'll click to edit it and double check after checking our identifiers on the client side we see that the local identifier is not the same as the remote identifier on the rv 340. we'll change the local identifier on the client side to greenbowvpn.com since the fqdn isn't an actual domain that we own we can change this on either side of the vpn it's important that both match after making the changes on the client side we see that the vpn is up and that we have a connection this is why logs are so important in the rv 340. they help us immensely when trying to troubleshoot common vpn issues those are just a few of the common vpn issues and how to troubleshoot them using router logs thanks for watching tech talks from cisco we'll see

With constant exposure to internet threats,\nbusinesses have to think about how to boost employee productivity and network performance\nby limiting unwanted network traffic. We\u2019ll talk about how, next. Small businesses are especially vulnerable\nto security threats. In fact, the National Cyber Security Alliance\nclaims that each year 20% of small businesses experience a cyber attack. And a cyber attack might just be serious enough\nto close a business down. With Cisco RV340-Series Security Routers,\nbusinesses can protect their network from unwanted content and malicious websites without\ncompromising the online experience. This series has four routers to choose from\n\u2013 the RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P. Each model shares these important features:\nGigabit Ethernet ports, wired NAT performance, business grade firewalling, and secure internet\nconnectivity. Where they differ is in the number of LAN\nports.The RV340 has dual WAN ports for load balancing and failover. And four LAN ports for high performance connectivity. The RV340W has the same features, but with\nwireless capabilities. The RV345 has dual WAN ports and an integrated\n16 LAN port switch to allow for more space and more ports for all devices in the LAN. The RV345P takes it a step further by adding\nPower Over Ethernet, or PoE, to help reduce the expense of installing electric power cabling. That allows for flexibility of delivering\npower in places without outlets to devices like wireless access points or voice over\nIP phones. No matter which router you choose, an easy\nconfiguration setup wizard is there every step of the way. And Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobile Client\nSoftware is supported for iPhone, Android, Windows 10 or MacBook laptops. Block unwanted categories, dynamically blacklist\nwebsites, and set individual policies for applications to keep the network safe. The RV340 Series from Cisco. Scalable. Secure. Affordable. It\u2019s what small businesses need for the\nultimate in business efficiency. Thanks for watching Tech Talks from Cisco. We\u2019ll see you next time.",

close proximity are broadcasting at the same frequency or channel the transmitted data can become corrupted or canceled out the bad news is that can greatly decrease performance the good news is it's easy to avoid today I'm going to show you how to configure advanced radio settings on the web 125 and web 581 for optimum wireless capability without worrying about interference interruptions let's get started first log into the web-based utility and choose Wireless then radio from the drop-down menu next select the radio interface you want to configure in our example today radio 1 5 gigahertz is selected what's the difference between the two the 2.4 gigahertz frequency is more compatible with older devices since it caters to 802 11 B G and n modes and has a wider range the 5 gigahertz frequency caters to 802 11 AC and n modes and is faster but has a shorter range one other thing to note on the WEP 125 the option to choose the radio is available only when the working mode has been set to dual band under the basic settings area make sure to check the enable radio button this is enabled by default next navigate to the Advanced Settings area and click the arrow next to it to expand the page and configure the settings for the chosen radio it's important to note that DFS support and spectrum analysis mode options will only be available on the web 581 also the DFS support field is only available if you are configuring radio 1 5 gigahertz dynamic frequency selection DFS automatically selects channel frequencies with the lowest interference use the drop-down list to either enable or disable this feature in our example the default is on if you are configuring radio to skip to the next step if you selected a mode that contains 802 11 n in wireless network mode drop-down in the basic settings area the short guard interval supported drop-down lists will be available the guard interval is the amount of time that the WAP weights between transmissions which prevents interference the guard interval can be shortened to increase throughput by up to 10% if this option is available select an option from the drop down list yes reduces transmission time to over 400 nanoseconds when communicating with clients that also support the short guard interval this is the default option no keeps transmission time to every 800 nanoseconds in this example yes is chosen choose an option from the protection drop-down list the protection feature contains rules to guarantee that a tow 2.11 transmission does not cause interference with legacy stations or application auto enables protection when legacy devices are within the range of the web this is the default option in this example auto is chosen in the beacon interval field enter the interval of milliseconds between beacon frame transmissions beacon frames announce the presence of the wireless network the value must be between 20 and 2,000 milliseconds the default is 100 cisco recommends keeping the default value a misconfigured beacon interval can cause clients to be unable to connect in this example you guessed it 100 is used next up is the delivery traffic information map period field here you will enter an integer from 1 to 255 beacons the DTM period indicates how often in terms of beacon frames the client served by your web should check for buffered data still awaiting pickup the default value is 2 which specifies that clients will check for buffered data on your web on every second beacon frame in the fragmentation threshold field enter an even number between 256 and 2346 bytes to specify the size limit for packets transmitted over the network if a packet exceeds the fragmentation threshold the fragmentation function is activated and the packet is sent as multiple 802 11 frames by default fragmentation is off at a threshold of 2346 bytes changing the fragmentation threshold is not recommended unless you experience radio threshold in our example 2346 is used in the RTS threshold field enter an integer between zero and two thousand three hundred and forty seven to specify the request to send threshold value the default here is two thousand three hundred and forty six a lower threshold value sends packets more frequently which results in higher bandwidth consumption and quicker recovery from collisions or interference on the network in this example 65535 is used in the max associated clients field enter the maximum number of clients that can connect to the web at one time the range is from zero to 200 with a default setting of 200 in the transmit power drop-down list select the percentage of transmit power the web uses when broadcasting a high percentage is more cost-efficient since it gives the web the widest range and requires fewer access points to cover the same area a low percentage requires devices to be close to each other but reduces the overlap and interference among apps the default is full 100 percent in the frame burst support drop-down list choose either off or on to disable or enable this feature choosing on may increased downstream throughput as it lets the radio quickly send a series of frames in secession for a brief period of time next up is the airtime fairness mode drop-down list this feature allows every clients connected to the web to have an equal opportunity to take advantage of the network bandwidth regardless of type capability or operating systems choose on or off in the maximum utilization threshold field enter the percentage of network bandwidth utilization allowed on the radio before the web stops accepting new client association the range is from 0 to 100% the default is 0 when it is set to 0 all new associations are allowed regardless of their utilization rate in the fixed multicast rate drop-down list select the transmission rate in megabits per second for broadcast and multicast packets the range of possible values is determined by the radio mode in the basic settings area selecting Auto lets the web automatically choose the best rate based on the connected clients today we are choosing Auto in the legacy rate set stable check the boxes under the available rates to determine the supported and basic rate sets supported is just how it sounds it indicates rates that the web supports basic rate sets are what the web advertises to the network to set up communication with other devices it is more efficient to have a WAP broadcast a subset of its support rates the rates are in megabits per second remember in order to select a rate as basic it must also be selected as supported check the broadcast multicast rate-limiting checkbox if you want to limit the number of packets transmitted across the network by default this feature is disabled if you enable broadcast multicast rate limiting the rate limit and rate limit burst fields will become available enter the appropriate values for each field rate limit is for multicast and broadcast traffic the rate is expressed in packets per second and the range is 1 through 50 the default is 50 rate limit burst indicates the amount of traffic that is allowed to pass as a temporary burst even if it exceeds the above maximum rate the range is 1 through 75 and the default is 75 in the spectrum analysis mode drop-down list choose a mode in which the web will conduct an analysis of the wireless environment options include dedicated spectrum analyzer where the radio is used for spectrum analysis for more than 10 percent of the time and the client connections may work but are not guaranteed hybrid spectrum analyzer where client connections are guaranteed but degradation is expected throughout 3+1 spectrum analyzer where clients connect to 3 by 3 chains while the spectrum analysis is done on a one by one chain and disabled which is the default mode remember spectrum analysis mode is only available on the web 581 here we've chosen the default mode of disable if necessary check the very high through or VHT features checkbox to enable the Broadcom specific extension for Broadcom to Broadcom links click the blue configure t spec button to open the fields and configure T spec settings first enter the T spec violation interval in seconds for the web to report associated clients that do not adhere to mandatory admission control procedures this reporting occurs through the system log and simple network management protocol traps otherwise known as SNMP the range is from 0 to 900 with a default of 300 in the T spec mode drop-down list choose the traffic specification mode for the web this is sent from a quality of service capable clients requesting a certain amount of traffic from the web shoes on to enable T spec and allow the web to handle traffic from quality of service devices shoes off to disable T spec and quality of service devices are not given priority in the T spec voice ACM mode drop-down list choose a mode that regulates mandatory admission control or a cm for the voice access category choose on to require that a station send a t spec request for bandwidth to the web before sending or receiving a voice traffic stream shoes off to allow stations to send and receive voice traffic without a t spec request this allows the web to control bandwidth usage for voice traffic in this example off is chosen in the T spec voice ACM limit field enter the maximum amount of traffic the web tries to transmit through wireless with a voice AC to gain access the range is 0 to 70% and the default is 20% in the T spec video ACM mode drop-down list choose a mode that regulates mandatory admission control or a cm for the video access category choose on to require that a station send a T spec request for bandwidth to the web before sending or receiving a video traffic stream shoes off to allow stations to send and receive video traffic without a t spec request as in the voice traffic section this allows the web to have control over bandwidth usage for video traffic in this example off is chosen next up is the T spec video ACM limit filled here enter the maximum amount of traffic the web tries to transmit through wireless with a video AC to gain access the range is from 0 to 70% and the default is at 15% in the T spec ap inactivity timeout field enter the number of seconds for a web to detect a downlink traffic specification as idle before deleting it the range is 0 to 120 seconds and the default is 30 entering 0 disables this feature in the T spec station inactivity timeout field enter the number of seconds for a web to detect an uplink traffic specification as idle before deleting it the range is 0 to 120 seconds and the default is 30 entering 0 disables this feature in the T spec legacy wmm queue map mode drop-down list select whether to enable or disable the intermixing of legacy traffic on queues operating as a CM by default this feature is disabled click OK to save your changes click Save a pop-up window will appear telling you that wireless connections may be disconnected upon saving the changes you made in your wireless settings click OK to continue congratulations you have now successfully configured the advanced radio

fragmentation is off at a threshold of 2346 bytes changing the fragmentation threshold is not recommended unless you experience radio threshold in our example 2346 is used in the RTS threshold field enter an integer between zero and two thousand three hundred and forty seven to specify the request to send threshold value the default here is two thousand three hundred and forty six a lower threshold value sends packets more frequently which results in higher bandwidth consumption and quicker recovery from collisions or interference on the network in this example 65535 is used in the max associated clients field enter the maximum number of clients that can connect to the web at one time the range is from zero to 200 with a default setting of 200 in the transmit power drop-down list select the percentage of transmit power the web uses when broadcasting a high percentage is more cost-efficient since it gives the web the widest range and requires fewer access points to cover the same area a low percentage requires devices to be close to each other but reduces the overlap and interference among apps the default is full 100 percent in the frame burst support drop-down list choose either off or on to disable or enable this feature choosing on may increased downstream throughput as it lets the radio quickly send a series of frames in secession for a brief period of time next up is the airtime fairness mode drop-down list this feature allows every clients connected to the web to have an equal opportunity to take advantage of the network bandwidth regardless of type capability or operating systems choose on or off in the maximum utilization threshold field enter the percentage of network bandwidth utilization allowed on the radio before the web stops accepting new client association the range is from 0 to 100% the default is 0 when it is set to 0 all new associations are allowed regardless of their utilization rate in the fixed multicast rate drop-down list select the transmission rate in megabits per second for broadcast and multicast packets the range of possible values is determined by the radio mode in the basic settings area selecting Auto lets the web automatically choose the best rate based on the connected clients today we are choosing Auto in the legacy rate set stable check the boxes under the available rates to determine the supported and basic rate sets supported is just how it sounds it indicates rates that the web supports basic rate sets are what the web advertises to the network to set up communication with other devices it is more efficient to have a WAP broadcast a subset of its support rates the rates are in megabits per second remember in order to select a rate as basic it must also be selected as supported check the broadcast multicast rate-limiting checkbox if you want to limit the number of packets transmitted across the network by default this feature is disabled if you enable broadcast multicast rate limiting the rate limit and rate limit burst fields will become available enter the appropriate values for each field rate limit is for multicast and broadcast traffic the rate is expressed in packets per second and the range is 1 through 50 the default is 50 rate limit burst indicates the amount of traffic that is allowed to pass as a temporary burst even if it exceeds the above maximum rate the range is 1 through 75 and the default is 75 in the spectrum analysis mode drop-down list choose a mode in which the web will conduct an analysis of the wireless environment options include dedicated spectrum analyzer where the radio is used for spectrum analysis for more than 10 percent of the time and the client connections may work but are not guaranteed hybrid spectrum analyzer where client connections are guaranteed but degradation is expected throughout 3+1 spectrum analyzer where clients connect to 3 by 3 chains while the spectrum analysis is done on a one by one chain and disabled which is the default mode remember spectrum analysis mode is only available on the web 581 here we've chosen the default mode of disable if necessary check the very high through or VHT features checkbox to enable the Broadcom specific extension for Broadcom to Broadcom links click the blue configure t spec button to open the fields and configure T spec settings first enter the T spec violation interval in seconds for the web to report associated clients that do not adhere to mandatory admission control procedures this reporting occurs through the system log and simple network management protocol traps otherwise known as SNMP the range is from 0 to 900 with a default of 300 in the T spec mode drop-down list choose the traffic specification mode for the web this is sent from a quality of service capable clients requesting a certain amount of traffic from the web shoes on to enable T spec and allow the web to handle traffic from quality of service devices shoes off to disable T spec and quality of service devices are not given priority in the T spec voice ACM mode drop-down list choose a mode that regulates mandatory admission control or a cm for the voice access category choose on to require that a station send a t spec request for bandwidth to the web before sending or receiving a voice traffic stream shoes off to allow stations to send and receive voice traffic without a t spec request this allows the web to control bandwidth usage for voice traffic in this example off is chosen in the T spec voice ACM limit field enter the maximum amount of traffic the web tries to transmit through wireless with a voice AC to gain access the range is 0 to 70% and the default is 20% in the T spec video ACM mode drop-down list choose a mode that regulates mandatory admission control or a cm for the video access category choose on to require that a station send a T spec request for bandwidth to the web before sending or receiving a video traffic stream shoes off to allow stations to send and receive video traffic without a t spec request as in the voice traffic section this allows the web to have control over bandwidth usage for video traffic in this example off is chosen next up is the T spec video ACM limit filled here enter the maximum amount of traffic the web tries to transmit through wireless with a video AC to gain access the range is from 0 to 70% and the default is at 15% in the T spec ap inactivity timeout field enter the number of seconds for a web to detect a downlink traffic specification as idle before deleting it the range is 0 to 120 seconds and the default is 30 entering 0 disables this feature in the T spec station inactivity timeout field enter the number of seconds for a web to detect an uplink traffic specification as idle before deleting it the range is 0 to 120 seconds and the default is 30 entering 0 disables this feature in the T spec legacy wmm queue map mode drop-down list select whether to enable or disable the intermixing of legacy traffic on queues operating as a CM by default this feature is disabled click OK to save your changes click Save a pop-up window will appear telling you

We'll start by going over how to download\nCisco's AnyConnect VPN client and then discuss the SSL VPN configuration associated with\nthe RV340 and RV345. First, download the Cisco AnyConnnect VPN\nclient from the Cisco AnyConnect website. Next, run the installer to install the VPN\nclient. Connect to and log in to your device. From the homepage, click VPN, then SSL VPN. Under the General Configuration tab, you can\nconfigure both mandatory and optional gateway settings that relate to your SSL VPN server. Then, under the Group Policies tab, click\nAdd, Edit, or Delete to edit basic VPN information such as names, DNS settings, and WINS settings. For both of these tabs, click Apply to apply\nyour changes. An example configuration would be as follows:\ngo to the VPN tab and click the SSL VPN. Under the General Configuration tab, click\nthe On bubble next to \"Cisco SSL VPN Server.\" Next, leave all fields default, but set the\nClient Address Pool field to the IP address of the desired pool. This address pool should be preferably different\nthan any LAN DHCP ranges in your network. You may also wish to change the client domain\nand what's displayed on the login banner. click Apply when you are finished. Then, under the Group Policies tab, click\nAdd to add a new SSL VPN group table. Next, type in the desired policy name, secondary\nDNS, primary WINS, secondary WINS, and description. We'll leave IE Proxy settings disabled and\nthe Enable Split Tunneling box unchecked. Click Apply when finished. Now to connect, open up the AnyConnect Mobility\nClient and enter an IP which is reachable from the WAN to the router, followed by the\ndefault gateway port of 8443 set earlier. Click Connect. If you have user accounts set up you'll be\nprompted to enter a username and password to connect. The login banner is then displayed which must\nbe accepted to continue. There should now be an SSL VPN connection\nbetween your client device and the router. To quickly test this open up command prompt\nand check the connection between your computer and the internal LAN IP of the router. Type the command \"ping\" followed by the address. By default, this will be 192.168.1.1. If you receive reply packets, this confirms\na connection was successful. At this point, you should have all the information\nyou need to use AnyConnect for basic SSL VPN connections for your RV340 and RV345 routers. I'm Keshav from Cisco, and thanks for watching.",

Today, we'll be going over fast link failover\non the SG550XG and the SG350XG series managed switches. Fast link failover is a process\ndesigned to reduce the duration of data packet loss in case a link in a stack port fails.\nThis process is only supported in a ring topology because, in this set up, the stack can still\nremain operational even if a link fails. Suppose we have four units\nin a stack that are set up in a ring topology, where unit one can send traffic to unit two\nor unit four. If unit one is supposed to send traffic to unit three, the traffic can be\nrouted in two ways: unit one to unit two to unit three, or unit one to unit four to unit\nthree. Therefore, if the link between units one and two fails, unit one can send traffic\nto unit three via unit four, and vice versa. Until the stack topology is\nrecovered, the stack unit sends back the packets that are supposed to be sent through the failed\nstack port, transmitting the packets through the connected stack port all the way to the\ndesignated unit. Fast Link Failover is a feature\nthat helps minimize data packet loss when a link in a stack port fails. This concludes\nour tutorial on fast link failover for the SG550XG and the SG350XG switches.

stackable switches please note however that the SG 550 XG and s G 350 XG cannot be linked in the same stack for all devices shown in this video we'll be using software version 2.1 point 0.46 let's get started a change apology is a linear connection between all units via stacking links starting with one switch each unit connects to its neighboring switch through a single cable between their stack boards and so the last unit has been linked with the one before it if a link between the two units fails the switch stack will be cut off where the failure occurs for this reason a chain topology is not very robust as it does not have for redundancy this is where ring topologies have an advantage in a ring topology all units in the stack are connected in a loop the last unit connecting back to the first by connecting them in this way you provide additional redundancy in the case of a failed stack link as seen here the failure of one link in a ring topology causes the stack to revert to a chain topology and maintains the stacks functionality thus a ring topology is more reliable than a chain topology and allows for more stable stack operation let's show you how to physically set up each topology for this demonstration we'll be using four SG 550 XG switches and a chain topology keep in mind that you can use any network port on the switch as a stack point let's start by taking a cable and connecting the first and second switch together take note of the ports you connect to on each switch you'll need this information when designating stock boards later then take another cable and connect the second and third switch together repeat this process for every switch you want to include in your stack a ring topology uses the same configuration as a chain except the last unit connects back to the first therefore in order to make the stack of ring topology we just connect the last switch back to the first one now that we have physically established a ring topology we'll go over their configurations in the graphical user interface this is where we designate the appropriate ports for each unit that will be used as stock boards for each switch you'll need to log in to the web configuration utility to configure the stock points start by logging into the first switch at the top of your stack and then click on administration and in stack management the stock management page shows your current stock topology and designates which switch in your stack is the stack master additionally it provides a visual stock topology view of your current stack since your stock boards have been been configured yet each switch is designated as the master of its own single unit chain topology under the unit view and stack port configuration section you can simply click on reports you want to designate a stacking ports for the switch these should be the same ports you use to connect your switches earlier note that in order to enable stacking at least two stacking ports must be selected in the graphical user interface by default there are no pre-configured sac boards on the switch you can designate to two for stacking ports in the SG 350 XG and 2 to 8 stacking ports on the SG 550 XG in the unit ID after reset drop-down list choose Auto in order to automatically assign each stock member a unique unit ID the assignment process will be based on each units MAC address and determine the initial master backup and slave units finally click apply and reboot to save your changes a confirmation window will open asking if you would like to continue click OK and your device will reboot now we simply need to configure the stock ports for the other three switches using the same procedure log into each switches web configuration utility navigate to administration and then stock management and designate the appropriate ports we are using in the physical setup after the changes have been applied in all switches and finish rebooting the four unit stack will be established once we log into our stock master and navigate to administration and stock management we're going to view new updated information on the stack under stock quality view all four units of the current ring topology appear and we can select each individual switch for stock configuration clicking on individual unit will show you which of its stacking ports are active and whether the unit is a master backup or slave within the topology a brief overview of your stock configuration can also be found in your master switches system summary if you click on status and statistics then system summary you can view the units in your stack as well as individual switch serial numbers and PID V ID numbers the SG 350 XG and SG 550 XG switches support stacking under two types of topologies ring and chain a ring topology is more favorable than a change apology due to its additional redundancy however both topologies can be used to establish a functional stack to configure each topology you need to physically link ports between each switch and then designate those ports as stack ports in the graphical user interface this concludes our tutorial on ring and chain topologies for more information

TODAY, WE\u2019RE GONNA BE GOING OVER THE AUTO-NUMBERING\nSTACKING MECHANISM THAT\u2019S FEATURED ON THE SG-550XG AND SG-350XG MANAGED SWITCHES. AUTO-NUMBERING IS USED TO AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN\nEACH UNIT WITH A SPECIFIC STACK UNIT ID BASED ON THE DEVICE\u2019S MAC ADDRESS. WHEN CONNECTING FOUR SG-550XG SWITCHES WITH\nAUTO-NUMBERING, WE CAN MAKE TWO OBSERVATIONS. ONE, THESE DEVICES CONVERGE ONTO A SINGLE\nSTACK AUTOMATICALLY. AND TWO, EACH DEVICE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY\nNUMBERED BASED ON ITS MAC ADDRESS. PLEASE NOTE THAT AUTO-NUMBERING WORKS IN THE\nSAME MANNER FOR A STACK OF SG-350XG SWITCHES AS IT DOES FOR A STACK OF SG-550XG SWITCHES. NOW, LET\u2019S LOOK AT SOME TOPOLOGIES YOU CAN\nUSE WHEN CONFIGURING YOUR STACK. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF STACKING TOPOLOGIES\nTHAT CAN BE USED WITH THIS SERIES OF SWITCHES: RING AND CHAIN. IN THIS TUTORIAL, WE WILL BE USING A RING\nTOPOLOGY. IN A RING TOPOLOGY, ALL THE SWITCHES ARE CONNECTED\nTO EACH OTHER IN A CLOSED LOOP. EACH UNIT IS CONNECTED TO TWO OTHER COMPONENTS\nON EITHER SIDE AND COMMUNICATES WITH THESE TWO ADJACENT NEIGHBORS. THE BENEFIT OF USING A RING TOPOLOGY IS THAT\nIF A LINK CONNECTION IN THE STACK FAILS, THE STACK WILL REMAIN ACTIVE. TO DEMONSTRATE THIS, WE MUST FIRST LOG IN\nTO THE WEB CONFIGURATION UTILITY. ONCE LOGGED IN, CLICK ON ADMINISTRATION, THEN\nCLICK ON STACK MANAGEMENT. IN THIS PAGE, YOU CAN VIEW WHAT STACK TOPOLOGY\nYOU HAVE AND WHICH UNIT IS THE STACK MASTER. TO CONFIGURE THE STACK PORTS, CLICK ON THE\nPORT FOUND ON THE SWITCH GUI. NEXT, WE WILL BE ENABLING THE STACK PORTS. WE SHOULD NOTE THAT ANY PORT ON THE SWITCH\nCAN BECOME A STACK PORT. MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIT ID AFTER RESET FIELD\nIS SET TO AUTO. YOU CAN SPECIFY ADDITIONAL STACK PORTS IF\nYOU WANT. CLICK APPLY AND REBOOT TO SAVE YOUR CHANGES. DO THIS WITH THE OTHER SWITCHES IN YOUR TOPOLOGY. THE AUTO NUMBERING ALGORITHM SETS DEVICES\nWITH THE LOWEST MAC ADDRESS TO THE LOWEST UNIT NUMBER, WHICH IS UNIT ONE. IN THE STACK MANAGEMENT PANEL, YOU CAN SELECT\nA SWITCH IN THE STACK TOPOLOGY VIEW TO SEE ITS UNIT ID. YOU ARE ALSO ABLE TO CHANGE THE STACKING TOPOLOGY\nTO ANY TOPOLOGY YOU WANT WITHOUT REBOOTING THE SWITCH. AS YOU REARRANGE YOUR CABLES, THE GOOEY WILL\nALERT YOU ON ANY CHANGES MADE TO THE TOPOLOGY. SIMILARLY, YOU CAN OBSERVE THE PORT\u2019S STATUS\nAND CHECK FOR AN ACTIVE CONNECTION. THE AUTO NUMBERING FEATURE ON THE SG-550XG\nAND SG-350XG SWITCHES IS AN EASY WAY TO SET UP YOUR NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND AUTOMATICALLY\nASSIGN SWITCHES TO WORK SEAMLESSLY. YOU CAN USE THE WEB CONFIGURATION UTILITY\nTO VIEW AN OVERVIEW OF THE SWITCHES AND SEE WHAT KIND OF TOPOLOGY YOU HAVE, AS WELL AS\nCONNECTIONS TO OTHER SWITCHES.
